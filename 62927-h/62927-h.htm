CHAPTER I<br />

<small>DIANE, THE DREAMER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lazy blue river and the wide, brown
plains of Picardy lay basking in the still splendor
of the November afternoon. The mysterious
hush of the autumn lay upon the fields and the
farmsteads. A flock of herons in a near-by
marsh meditated gravely, standing one-legged,
and watching the cows kneedeep in the muddy
meadows. High in the sunny air, a vulture
sailed, majestically evil, watching both the cows
and the herons. The world was saying farewell
softly to the sunny hours.</p>

<p>The only sound that broke the deep silence
was the steady trot of the big Normandy horses
on the flinty towpath, as they drew a covered
boat along the narrow and shallow stream, and
the faint echo of the voices of five persons sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
on the roof of the boat in the sunshine. The
herons cocked their eyes toward the boat, and
listened attentively, though they could not understand
a word of these strange, noisy, laughing,
weeping, fighting, dancing, talking creatures,
called men and women. Sometimes, so the
herons thought, these odd beings were a little
kind; sometimes they were very cruel, but
always they were formidable, and were masters
of life and death.</p>

<p>The great question under discussion on the
roof of the boat was, where the theatrical company
of jugglers and singers should spend the
winter. Grandin, the proprietor of the show,
a tall, handsome, boastful man, with a big voice
like a church organ and a backbone made of
brown paper, always gave his opinion first, but
was generally overruled by Madame Grandin, also
tall, handsome, easily wheedled or bullied, but
inexorably truthful. Decisions really rested with
the three subordinates, Diane Dorian, the prima
donna, Jean Leroux, her partner, and the individual
known as François le Bourgeois, juggler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have determined upon Bienville,&#8221; roared
Grandin, in his big, rich voice. &#8220;We wintered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
there nine years ago, and my lithograph was in
some of the best shops in the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a lie!&#8221; cried Madame Grandin,
amiably. &#8220;They only put your picture in three
butcher shops and the bake shop across the street,
and I am sure you paid enough for it. But
Bienville is my choice too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandin took this with the utmost good
nature. Between his propensity to tell agreeable
lies, and Madame Grandin&#8217;s natural inability
to let a lie go uncontradicted, the couple
struck a very good average of truth.</p>

<p>The manager and his wife having spoken, the
real discussion was now on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say Bienville,&#8221; said Jean Leroux,
quietly.</p>

<p>He, too, was big&mdash;an ugly, resolute man with
an indomitable eye, and as honest as the day
was long.</p>

<p>He looked at Diane as he spoke. She was
dark haired and dark eyed, with a skin milk
white in spite of grease paint, and had a vivid,
irregular, theatrical beauty, in great contrast to
the big, Juno-like manager&#8217;s wife. Also, she
was so slight and thin as to deserve the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
&#8220;Skinny,&#8221; which was freely applied to her by
François, and she had a voice like the flute of
Pan. In spite of her soft voice and gently drooping
head, Diane had ten times the resolution of
the resolute Jean Leroux. She was also the
vainest of women, and in order to protect her
matchless complexion wore, over her scarlet
hood, a transparent veil of a misty grey, through
which her eyes shone as the flash of stars is seen
through a drifting cloud. Jean Leroux, who
frankly adored her, sat at her right, and François,
who always laughed at her, sat on the other
side. This François had the clear cut, highbred
features, the slim hands and feet, that indescribable
air of the aristocrat which marks a
man who can trace his descent through many
lines of greatness, back to those who shone at
the court of Philippe le Bel. Yet François was
a frowzy person, and his small feet had burst
through his shoes; but he had the same glorious
and ineffable impudence of his ancestors who
bullied their kings and princes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say, Diane?&#8221; he asked, giving
Diane a friendly kick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say Bienville,&#8221; replied Diane in her lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
stage voice. &#8220;I was born and brought up five
miles from Bienville, in a little hole of a house,
for my father, the village hatter, and my mother
had a hard time to keep body and soul together.
When I was a little, little girl, I used to look in
clear days toward Bienville where I could see
the tall spires of the cathedral making a dark
line against the sky, and I used to imagine I
could hear the bells on the clear December days,
and in the soft summer nights. I yearned with
all my heart to go to Bienville on market day,
and to see the wonderful things that I had heard
of there. My mother and father were always
promising me that when they had enough money
they would take me to Bienville on a market day,
but, poor souls, they never had enough. So
then, when they died and I was twelve years old,
I was taken far away by my uncle. I never saw
Bienville, and tended geese until I was sixteen
and begun to sing at the village festivals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How interesting!&#8221; cried François, who had
heard the story forty times before. &#8220;When you
are prima donna at the Paris Opera, and your
noble lineage is acknowledged by the proudest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
houses in France, it will be so romantic to hear
&#8216;The Tale of the Goose Girl&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was an old joke of François&#8217;, at which
everybody was expected to laugh, but Diane
remained sullenly silent. François had told her
by way of a gibe that her name, Dorian, was
undoubtedly a corruption of the noble name of
D&#8217;Orian, and the ridiculous story had taken
possession of Diane, who was as ambitious as
Julius Cæsar, and not without repartee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; she answered tartly, &#8220;it is better
to rise from being a goose girl to being a singer
in a nice company like this, than&mdash;&#8221; Diane
stopped, but François finished the sentence for
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Than to be born in a chateau and come down
to being general utility man in a nice, though
small, theatrical company. But I tell you,
ladies and gentlemen, that the fault is in the
stars, not in me. God is a great showman, and
arranges many highly dramatic events in certain
lives. He has a little string, which He calls
Life, and when He pulls it, we walk, talk, and sin.
And when He cuts that string, we walk, talk, and
sin no more. To return to the concrete, however&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
give my voice for Bienville too, because
the Bishop is a friend of mine, and so is the major
general commanding the district.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, François had never before been known
to mention any great people he had ever known
in his former life, claiming acquaintance only
with organ-grinders, ratcatchers, and the like.
So all present pricked up their ears at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was a little lad five years old,&#8221; continued
François, &#8220;they wanted to teach me to
read, but I did not want to read, so then I was
taken into the meadows and shown two big boys,
twelve and fourteen years old, who watched the
cows, and meanwhile each carried a book which
he read every moment he could. One of those
boys has become Bishop of Bienville, and the
other, I tell you, is a major general commanding.
I suppose they will turn up their noses at me, as
indeed they should. But Bienville is the place
for the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three subordinates having spoken, the
question of spending the winter in Bienville was
considered settled, provided they could get a
cheap hall in which to give performances three
times a week. The horses were to be sold, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
they always were at the end of a season, and the
boat tied up at the quay, because it could not be
heated for winter weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Diane, &#8220;that the summer
is over, and this is the last time for this year that
we shall travel by water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane did not suspect that it was the last time
she should ever travel in that way again.</p>

<p>The horses trotted on steadily toward the far-off
steeples and roofs of Bienville coming within
clear sight. By that time it was nearly dusk,
and a great golden, smoky moon hung in the
heavens. The boat was stopped on the river
bank where the streets of the little town ran
down to the waterside. The horses were taken
out, rubbed down, and fed, while the Juno-like
manager&#8217;s wife and the future prima donna of
the Paris Opera cooked supper. Presently
they were all assembled around a little table in
the small, stuffy cabin, lighted by a kerosene
lamp hung on the beam over their heads. They
were very humble people, and poor, but they
were not unhappy, and lived in a singular harmony
together, in spite of the fact that the three
ruling spirits, Diane, Jean Leroux, and François<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
were all made on a special model. But each had
that strange, artistic conscience which begets the
iron discipline of the stage. Apart from the
stage, François was frankly an outlaw, and submitted
to things because there was always a
strong and relentless world against him.</p>

<p>When supper was over and everything settled
for the night, Grandin and his wife were soon
snoring loudly in the little coop which was their
room. Diane was not in her little coop, nor was
Jean Leroux huddled in his blanket in the large
cabin which he shared with François. Both
Diane and Jean were sitting on the roof of the
cabin watching the moon and stars reflected in
the black river, and listening to the sounds
brought to them upon the wandering breeze of a
merry little town at night. Jean Leroux, a
taciturn man, was, as usual, on or off the stage,
watching Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last I am in Bienville,&#8221; murmured Diane.
&#8220;After so many years of longing and yearning!
I feel that something will happen to me here,
something great and splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Diane,&#8221; said Leroux, &#8220;don&#8217;t let François&#8217;
jokes get into your head as serious things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Nothing is going to happen here. You sing
pretty well, but you have no more chance of
being a great opera singer than I have of being
an archbishop. You haven&#8217;t the voice, my dear,
for opera at all. You will never get beyond a
good music hall artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so discouraging, Jean,&#8221; complained
Diane. &#8220;You have a fine voice and know how
to act too, but you never aspire to anything but
a music hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and I never mean to,&#8221; was the reply of
the practical Jean. &#8220;I wish you had good
sense, Diane. But I love you just the same as
if you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane made no reply, and Jean was confirmed
in his belief that women were the most obstinate
and senseless creatures on earth when once they
took a notion into their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; continued Jean, &#8220;you are too old,
twenty-six, to begin training for grand opera,
and you haven&#8217;t the money either. At this
moment, your capital consists of two hundred
and forty-six francs; you told me so yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred and sixty-six francs,&#8221; cried
Diane with flashing eyes. &#8220;You ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
more careful how you talk about such important
things, Jean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; answered Jean gruffly, &#8220;for you
to try grand opera would be exactly like a cow
trying to play the piano.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane argued with him angrily for half an
hour. She had not the slightest intention or
even wish to be a grand opera singer, and knew
the absurdity of the situation quite as well as
Jean. But having, like all women, great powers
of deception, she was carefully concealing the
true object of her wishes and ambitions&mdash;to go
to Paris and become a great music hall
artist, a profession which she consistently
derided and contemned. The simple creature,
man, is no match for the complex creature,
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; murmured Diane, &#8220;I am in Bienville.
I have dreamed three times lately of
putting on my petticoat wrong side out, and that
means that I shall make a great deal of money.
And then I have twice dreamed of cooking
onions, and that means a splendid lover.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was more than Jean could stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Diane,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you had better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
go to bed now, and dream of petticoats and love
and onions. I am off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean got up and took Diane&#8217;s hand as she ran
nimbly down the short ladder to the deck of the
boat. The touch of that hand thrilled poor Jean.
His heart yearned over Diane; she was such a
fool, and always wanted to do things and to get
in places for which she was eternally unfitted,
so Jean thought. As a matter of fact, Diane
was as practical as Jean, but chose to talk a little
wildly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Diane in her little coop was sitting
on the edge of her bed and looking through the
small, square window toward the town. Afar
off she heard the echo of a military band playing.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a garrison here,&#8221; she thought to
herself, and then suddenly remembered that the
silk petticoat of which she had dreamed was red
like the color of the soldiers&#8217; trousers, and also
that the onions which she had cooked in her
dreams were red. Then her mind wandered to
Jean. If she should have a splendid lover, how
should she get on without Jean? It was he
who taught her most that she knew about singing
and had a peculiar scowl that he gave her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
on the stage when she was getting off the key.
Jean evidently did not fit into the plan of the
splendid marriage which she was certain to make
in Bienville, nor did anything seem to fit without
Jean. While Diane was puzzling over this, she
slipped into her narrow cot and fell asleep, the
laughing stars and grinning moon gazing at her
through the little window.</p>

<p>The next morning began the serious business
of going into winter quarters at Bienville. It was
a busy day for Jean. First, the horses had to
be sold. Anybody who flattered Grandin could
get horses or anything else out of him, so Jean
felt it his duty to go with the manager to the
horse mart where the horses fetched a good price.</p>

<p>François, who was very little use in any way,
except doing his stage tricks, was with Madame
Grandin and Diane, looking for lodgings. Jean
had some confidence in Diane&#8217;s management of
money, but this confidence was rudely shattered
when he and Grandin met the two ladies at the
corner of a street, and were taken to inspect the
lodgings which were under consideration for the
whole party. First, Jean was dubious about
the street, which was much too nice. The sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the lodgings confirmed his worst suspicions.
There was actually a sitting room in addition to
a bedroom for the Grandins, a little kitchen,
and beyond it a small white room, with a fireplace,
for Diane. Under the roof was a big
attic where Jean and François could be accommodated
royally. The price, of course, was
staggering, one hundred francs the month. For
once, however, Jean found himself unable to
move Diane or to bully the Grandins.</p>

<p>While they were all in the sitting room arguing
at the top of their lungs, Diane&#8217;s high-pitched,
musical voice cutting in every ten seconds, the
door opened and in walked François.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, François,&#8221; said Jean, &#8220;help me
to reason with these people. A hundred francs
for lodgings, and we haven&#8217;t even got a hall yet,
and don&#8217;t know whether anybody will come to
the performances or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred francs! A bagatelle!&#8221; cried
François, slapping his hat down on the table.
&#8220;Do you suppose when I come to a place where
the Bishop and the general commanding are my
friends, that I intend to stand back for a little
money? No, indeed. If we are thrown out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
these luxurious quarters, we can all go to the
workhouse anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look at this!&#8221; cried Jean, pointing to the
carpet on the floor, and the mirrors on the walls.</p>

<p>&#8220;But come and look at my bedroom. I am
sure that&#8217;s plain enough,&#8221; shrieked Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the best bedroom you ever had in your
life,&#8221; growled Jean.</p>

<p>Then they all trooped back beyond the kitchen
to the little white room for Diane. There was
one window in it, and it looked across the street
directly in the garden of a small, but very nice
hotel, much frequented by officers. There was
a pavilion enclosed in glass, and at that moment
there were officers breakfasting there, with their
swords about their legs. As Diane and the
rest watched, an orderly rode up leading an
officer&#8217;s horse. Then the officer came out, a
handsome young man in a splendid dragoon
uniform, and putting on his helmet with its gorgeous
red plume waving in the sunny air. He
mounted and clattered off, followed by the orderly
and also by the eyes of Diane. Jean,
looking at her, felt a knife enter his heart. Her
eyes had been fixed upon the young officer with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a look of enchantment; her red lips were partly
open. She was like a person hypnotized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diane will be a big success with the officers of
the garrison,&#8221; said François, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean with the corporals,&#8221; said Jean.
&#8220;François, you remind me of those soldiers
called gentlemen-rankers, gentlemen, that is,
who get into the ranks. They always give
trouble. You don&#8217;t belong with us. You ought
to go with people of your own kind, who understand
your jokes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t,&#8221; responded François, with unabashed
good humor. &#8220;They have kicked me
out long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, the discussion about the lodgings began
all over again, everybody talking at once, except
Diane who remained perfectly silent. When
they were talked out, Diane spoke a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take the whole apartment myself, if
the rest of you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have two
hundred and sixty-six francs of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean said no more, and Grandin sent for the
landlady, and made the terms, Jean looking
after him that he did nothing more wildly foolish
than to take the apartment at a hundred francs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>When that business was over, the whole party
started out to find a hall suitable for their performances.
In this they had extraordinary good
luck, finding a large place in the same street,
the whole front of glass, and which had been
lately vacated as a furniture shop. It would not
take much to build a little stage, and the dressing-rooms
could be divided off with canvas. Jean
then piloted the whole party to the office of the
agent, where Diane was put forward to make the
plea for the company. The agent was a susceptible
person, and Diane&#8217;s soft eyes and arguments
that the place would become better known
by having many persons attend it, caused him to
make a ridiculously low offer, and it was
promptly accepted. On the strength of this,
Diane assumed to be a fine business woman, and
gave herself great airs in consequence.</p>

<p>When all was complete, the entire arrangements
were not so bad. The money received
for the horses paid a month&#8217;s rent in advance
and for the erection of the stage. In the latter,
both Grandin and Jean helped the workmen and
nailed and hammered industriously. François
was willing to help too, but rather hindered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his jokes and stories, which distracted the workmen
and kept them laughing when they should
have been working.</p>

<p>At the end of three days everything was
settled for the winter. The beds and stools and
kettles and pans had been brought from the boat,
which was tied up for the season. The hall was
in readiness, the license was obtained, and the
big posters were out announcing three performances
a week by the celebrated Grandin troupe
of jugglers, singers, and dancers.</p>

<p>On the night of the first performance the hall
was so well filled that Grandin was in ecstasies
of delight, and Madame Grandin wept with joy.</p>

<p>Across the street, the pavilion was full of young
officers, dining. The new place evidently attracted
their attention, and presently the whole
crowd sallied forth through the garden of the
hotel, and across the street. At that moment,
François, by Grandin&#8217;s direction, went out to
see if the old woman who was hired to take in
the money was doing her duty. As the crowd
of laughing young officers crossed the street,
François, who had inspirations of genius, ran
inside and pulled up the great green shade before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
what had once been the shop windows. Within
could plainly be seen Diane doing one of her best
acts with Jean. She was dressed as a fishwife, her
skirts tucked up high, showing a charming pair
of ankles and small feet in little wooden shoes,
and a delicious white cap such as the fishwomen
wear flapped upon her beautiful black hair.
The officers raised a shout of laughter and applause
and dashed into the little hall, throwing
their money at the old woman, and not waiting
for change.</p>

<p>François pulled the curtain down, and rushed
back of the stage. As the officers came clattering
in, they were led by one whom François
recognized as the dragoon officer who had fascinated
Diane&#8217;s eyes three days before. This
made François nervous, because if the same thing
should happen, the act would be ruined. Diane,
indeed, had seen the young officer, but the effect
was exactly opposite from what François had
feared. This, thought Diane, was the meaning
of her dream. She sang better than ever before,
and no fishwife ever had so dramatic and delightful
a quarrel as she had with Jean. The
end of the act was that Diane gave Jean a beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with a broom, at which Jean bellowed, to the
great delight of the audience.</p>

<p>This audience, made up wholly of soldiers and
working people, except the officers, shouted with
laughter, and the young officers made more noise
than any one else present, led by the handsome
dragoon who had struck Diane&#8217;s fancy that
morning.</p>

<p>Diane was kept smiling and bowing, and blushing
under her grease paint, before the row of
candles stuck in bottles that represented the
footlights. This went on for so long that the
next feature on the bill, a juggling act in which
Grandin and his wife did miraculous things, was
delayed ten minutes. Madame Grandin, who
was more nearly without jealousy than any
woman François had ever known, sat quite
placidly in her tights and short skirts, and
wrapped in a shawl, waiting for the hullabaloo
to subside. Grandin was torn by rival emotions;
joy that Diane had made such a hit, and annoyance
that the audience seemed to prefer singing
to burning up money and making an egg come
out of a pumpkin. Presently, however, Jean
ruthlessly lowered the piece of canvas that did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
duty for a curtain, and Diane came back palpitating
and quivering between laughter and tears.
The Grandins then went on, and François, who
was not due on the stage for ten minutes, slipped
on his outside clothes over his stage costume and
quietly dropped into the audience and took his
seat by a laughing corporal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that young man over there?&#8221; whispered
François to the corporal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel,
captain of dragoons. I am in his troop.&#8221;</p>

<p>The corporal, as he said this, made a little
motion with his mouth, of which François knew
the meaning. It implied that Captain, the
Marquis Egmont de St. Angel was a person to
be spat upon.</p>

<p>François knew the name well enough; he knew
the names of all the great families. He gave
the corporal a wink, which was cordially returned,
and then went out, and to the back of
the stage. He found Diane sitting as if in a
dream in the little canvas den which she shared
as a dressing-room with Madame Grandin.
François, who was to go on in two minutes,
began jerking his arms about and bending his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
body as if it were made of India rubber, by way
of preparation, chatting meanwhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking about love and onions and petticoats,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;the young officer who led the
rest into the hall happens to be a cousin of mine,
about three removes, but we are blood relations,
just the same, and I think he will end in a worse
position than that of a juggler when he keeps
sober, and a street vender when he is not quite
so sober. He is the Marquis Egmont de St.
Angel, called Egmont for short. I was just
thinking,&#8221; continued François, making himself
into a circle like a snake, &#8220;that there are no such
things as trifles in this world. I went out just
now and pulled up the window shade, and a
certain man saw you. The pulling up of that
shade was a momentous act, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew something splendid would happen in
Bienville,&#8221; murmured Diane. &#8220;The Marquis
Egmont de St. Angel! What a splendid name!
I never had a hand clap from a marquis before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it was time for François to go on the
stage. He did his part, which was chiefly acrobatic,
so badly that he came near ruining the
Grandins&#8217; act.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Within the canvas den, Jean was preaching to
Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Diane,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t let those
young officers turn your head, particularly that
handsome one in front. They are not good acquaintances
for a girl like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane turned on him a look as virginal as that
of Jeanne d&#8217;Arc.</p>

<p>&#8220;No man can do me any harm,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;except break my heart. I suppose some might
do that. And besides, Jean, I am full of ambition.
The women who misbehave and drink
too much wine, lose their voices very soon and
are not respectfully treated by managers. Don&#8217;t
be afraid for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; answered Jean. &#8220;At least in the
way you think. I am afraid of your breaking
your heart and doing something foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t do anything foolish,&#8221; promptly
answered Diane.</p>

<p>When the Grandins and François finished their
act and the curtain was down, even the placid
Madame Grandin said a few mildly reproachful
words to François for his carelessness which
might have caused a bad accident. Grandin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
who was sincerely attached to his wife, was much
shaken and nervous and violently angry with
François.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; answered François coolly to
Grandin&#8217;s invectives, &#8220;wives come cheap, but
if you are so shaken in the next turn as you are
now, your wife will be in a great deal more danger
than she was with me. Behave yourself, Grandin,
and get the upper hand of your nerves. A
juggler who loses his nerve because another
juggler hasn&#8217;t tumbled fair, isn&#8217;t any good at all
and a very dangerous person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandin was much taken aback by this onslaught
of François, and could only mumble:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why it is, François, that you
always get the upper hand of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; replied François. &#8220;It is because
I was born a-horseback and you were born
a-footback. That&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second appearance of Diane upon the
stage was greeted with greater applause and
laughter than ever. Jean, who was a capital
low comedian and singer, was scarcely noticed.
When the act was over, it had to be repeated,
and at the end money was showered upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
stage. It was all silver, however, except one
twenty franc gold piece which was thrown by
the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel.</p>

<p>On the whole, the performance was a great
success as far as money went, but nobody had
got any applause to speak of except Diane.</p>

<p>It takes some time to wash off powder and
lamp-black and grease paint, and to get into
even the shabbiest clothes, so that the street
was almost deserted when the players came out
in the quiet autumn night. One person, however,
was on watch. This was the Marquis
Egmont de St. Angel, known as Egmont. He
stepped up to Diane and said with a low bow:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, will you do me the honor of
taking supper with me in the pavilion of the
Hotel Metropole?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you very much, Monsieur,&#8221; replied
Diane in her flute-like voice, &#8220;but I make it a
rule always to go home with my friends, Monsieur
and Madame Grandin, after the performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis remained silent for a moment,
then he said, bowing to Madame Grandin:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your friends will give me the pleasure
of their company too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&#8220;It is as they wish,&#8221; answered Diane. &#8220;But
I must return home. I cannot stay out late; it
affects my voice unfavorably.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis stared at her as if she were a
lunatic; he had never known stage people of
this class who refused anything to eat and drink.</p>

<p>Diane then, with Jean, started up the street
shepherded by the Grandins. When they
reached the corner, Grandin found his big,
melodious voice, and thundered at Diane:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by declining for us to go
to supper? I never went to supper with a
marquis in my life; it would be worth a hundred
francs&#8217; advertising!&#8221;</p>

<p>François had lagged behind, and was saying
to the Marquis,</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Fernand or Victor Egmont de St.
Angel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Fernand,&#8221; said the Marquis. &#8220;What
do you know about my family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, merely that we are cousins.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis shouted out laughing, while
François, rolling up his sleeve, gravely exhibited
his arm tattooed with a crest and initials.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was done,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when I was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
child, in case I got lost. I have got lost since
in the great, mysterious maze of the world, but
I have no objection, like that young lady yonder,
to go to supper with you, provided you will have
a good brand of champagne. Cheap champagne
is worse than bad acting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; cried the Marquis, &#8220;I know that
crest. You have indeed got lost! But you
shall have champagne at twenty francs the
bottle if you will tell me all about that young
lady who kicked about so beautifully in her
little wooden shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>François then slipped his arm within that of
the Marquis and the two paraded across the
quiet street singing at the top of their voices
some of the songs they had heard that evening
from the sweet lips of Diane.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of François that night, but
the next morning when Madame Grandin, who
added thrift and early rising to her other virtues,
was going out to the market at sunrise, she came
across François lying drunk on the door-step.
Madame Grandin, a good soul, instead of calling
her husband or Jean, who would be likely to use
François roughly, tiptoed to Diane&#8217;s door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the two women very quietly managed to get
François, who was a small man, up the stair, on
his way to his attic. As they passed Grandin&#8217;s
door, the manager appeared in a very sketchy
toilette.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with François?&#8221; asked
Grandin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drunk,&#8221; hiccoughed François, thickly, and
perfectly happy. &#8220;Too much high society.
Champagne at twenty francs the bottle, and my
cousin, the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel, paying
for it. Just let me sleep all day, and I will be
as sober as a judge by six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this actually happened.</p>

<p>It is a very serious thing for a juggler to get
drunk while he is juggling, but François, who
had as good artistic conscience as Jean Leroux
or anybody else, never attempted his profession
unless he were dead sober. That, he was,
at six o&#8217;clock when he walked into the little
sitting room and joined the rest of the party at
supper which was cooked by the excellent
Madame Grandin and Diane in collaboration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to do the pumpkin act with
me to-night, you dear old goose,&#8221; said François<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to Madame Grandin. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t risk your
precious life for anything. Where would Grandin
get as good a wife and as good a partner as
you if I should break your neck? And besides,
it would break up the show for a fortnight at
least, and perhaps ruin the whole season just as
Diane is in a fair way to become a marquise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, François?&#8221; asked Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that the young officer who admired
you so much was the Marquis Egmont de St.
Angel, a cousin of mine. We got gloriously
drunk together like old Socrates and the boy
Alcibiades the time that Socrates came in and
caught Alcibiades and a lot of Greek boys
drinking, and they swore that Socrates should
drink two measures of wine to one of theirs,
which he did the whole night through, and in
the morning left them all lying about the floor
while he went and took a bath and then lectured
on the true, the beautiful, and the good in the
groves of Parnassus, with all the wisest men in
the town at his heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who was Parnassus?&#8221; inquired Grandin
in his big voice. &#8220;His name sounds like a German
university professor.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what he was,&#8221; answered François.
&#8220;One of those <i>langsam schrecklich</i> German professors
who don&#8217;t mind having a mob of ragamuffins
overrunning the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>All present gazed with admiration at François,
amazed at his learning, as well as his great family
connections.</p>

<p>Diane&#8217;s thoughts were with the Marquis;
her face grew rose red as she wondered if the
Marquis would be on hand for that night&#8217;s
performance.</p>

CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE MARQUIS EGMONT OF THE HOLY ANGELS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Marquis, known familiarly as Egmont,
was at the music hall the next night, not in his
splendid dragoon uniform, nor yet in evening
dress, but in ordinary clothes which suggested
the notion of a disguise on Egmont&#8217;s part, to
François.</p>

<p>Evidently, the company as a whole, and
Diane in particular, had made a great hit, for
the former furniture shop was packed with
persons. François went through his juggling
and his tricks with the Grandins without the
slightest nervousness. Not so, Diane. She
began to give signs of what is dangerous and
even fatal to an actress&mdash;self-consciousness.
No one noticed it except Jean, who saw everything
with the sharp-sightedness of love.</p>

<p>When the performance was over, and the
hall closing for the night, the old woman who
took in the money at the door handed a note
to Diane, who slipped it into her breast. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
she got home and was alone in her little white
room, she took the note out and read it. Many
notes of the kind had Diane received in her short
theatrical career, chiefly from young shopmen
and susceptible lawyers&#8217; clerks and the like, but
this was from a marquis, and written upon
beautiful paper. It was very respectful in tone,
and asked Diane why she had been so cruel the
night before, and what evening would she honor
Captain, the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel with
her company at supper. The foolish Diane
kissed the note and slept with it under her pillow.</p>

<p>The next morning about ten o&#8217;clock, Diane
went out on a shopping expedition in the streets
of Bienville. She was one of those women who
have an instinctive knowledge of how to make
the best of herself. She adopted a demure
style of dress, a trim little black gown and large
black hat and a thin black veil, all of which gave
her a nun-like appearance. When she raised
her eyes, however, there was nothing of the nun
about Diane.</p>

<p>She walked rapidly along the bustling streets
of the town, and looked like a pretty governess
somewhat alarmed at being out alone. In truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Diane had been out in the world alone since her
seventeenth year, and knew perfectly well how
to take care of herself. She went into a paper
shop to buy some writing paper elegant enough
to reply to the Marquis&#8217;s note. As she walked
out of the shop, she came face to face with the
Marquis swinging along in his dashing uniform,
and carrying his sabre in his arm. He smiled
brilliantly at Diane and took off his glittering
helmet with its red plumes, and bowed profoundly
to her, but Diane, whose face became
scarlet as the dragoon&#8217;s plumes, turned and ran
as fast as she could, and was lost to sight, diving
into a narrow and devious street. She heard
footsteps behind her and kept her head down,
thinking it was the Marquis, but the voice in her
ear was that of Jean.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man means mischief as certainly as you
live, Diane,&#8221; said Jean, who had a brusqueness
and common sense sometimes most painful and
uncompromising.</p>

<p>Diane stopped under an archway, dark even
in the bright autumn morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what he means,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but neither he nor any other man can do me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
any harm. In the first place, I am by nature
a modest girl, you know that, Jean. Then, you
laugh at my ambitions. Very well; when the
time comes that the newspaper reporters are
digging into my past, they won&#8217;t find anything
disgraceful, upon that I am determined. If the
Marquis wants to marry me, I shall marry him.
But the only way he can reach me is through the
church door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean laughed a hearty, mirthful laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and as you always
were the most persevering and most determined
creature that ever lived, I think that you will
stick to what you say. But neither this marquis
nor any other marquis will ever want to marry
you. As for this fellow, he is a scoundrel. I
have heard it in the last twenty-four hours, and
I see it for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so prejudiced, Jean,&#8221; complained
Diane. &#8220;However, I will show you the note
that I shall write him, so that you can point out
any mistakes in spelling I may make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;François is the man for spelling,&#8221; answered
Jean.</p>

<p>Diane thought so too, so after writing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
little note first on a piece of wrapping paper&mdash;Diane
was nothing if not economical&mdash;she
showed it to François, who corrected two mistakes.
It was very short, simply saying that
Mademoiselle Dorian thanked the Marquis for
his compliment, but that she did not accept
invitations to supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wish, Skinny,&#8221; said François, &#8220;you
would go with him. He will be certain to say
or do something impudent, and that will disgust
you, and there will be an end of it. But you
are acting, my dear, like a finished coquette.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Diane violently denied, as it was the
truth and she did not wish it known.</p>

<p>The Marquis continued to haunt the little
hall every night, and the effect upon Diane&#8217;s
acting was not good, especially in a little love
scene she had with Jean.</p>

<p>After a week of this, one night when the performance
was over and they were all preparing
to go home, Jean spoke to Diane in her little
canvas den of a dressing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something is the matter. Your acting isn&#8217;t
improved, Diane,&#8221; said Jean, &#8220;by your eyes
wandering over the audience, and shrinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
away from me when you ought to throw yourself
in my arms. If you go on like this, you will
never get to Paris even as a music hall artist.
Your acting won&#8217;t be worth your railway fare,
third class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; answered Diane with pale lips.
&#8220;But while I am dressing I am asking myself
all the time, &#8216;Will the Marquis be in front?&#8217;
If he isn&#8217;t there, there doesn&#8217;t seem to me as if
there were anyone in the hall; then as soon as
he comes in he seems to fill the hall and to be
on the stage with me. Pity me, Jean!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; answered Jean, &#8220;from the bottom of
my heart, and I have a little pity for myself,
too. But, Diane, where is your courage, your
resolution, of which you are always boasting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is here,&#8221; answered Diane, laying her hand
upon her heart. &#8220;It is that which keeps me
away from him, which drags me to my room
when I want to go with the Marquis. It is that
which makes me a victor every hour, for I am
forever struggling to keep away from him, and
I <i>have</i> kept away from him. But when he comes
where I am&mdash;oh, Jean!&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane sat down on the rough box which held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
her stage wardrobe, consisting of two costumes,
and wept plentifully. Jean kneeled by her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t be a coward, Diane,&#8221; he cried
desperately. &#8220;Keep on struggling and fighting.
The fellow is a scoundrel, that I assure you. I
know the kind of a fight you are making. I
have had the same kind ever since I knew you.
Think what it is to me to take you in my arms
and then to throw you off as we do on the stage
every night. Think what it is to act when one
feels it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean stopped. The love of one man matters
little to a woman who is desperately in love with
another, but Diane, out of the depths of her
own agony, looked into Jean&#8217;s eyes and realized
that some one else could suffer besides herself.
They both forgot that François was changing his
clothes on the other side of the piece of canvas
and could hear every word. Suddenly François&#8217;
head appeared above the canvas partition
which was only about six feet high, and with
a convenient upturned bucket François, who
was a short man, could mount and see over
into the next canvas den.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it is,&#8221; cried François, laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
&#8220;You know the Spanish proverb, &#8216;I am
dying for you and you are dying for him who is
dying for someone else.&#8217; I haven&#8217;t even the
privilege of taking you in my arms, Diane, on
the stage, like Jean. This is a cursed world!&#8221;</p>

<p>There can be no secrets in a travelling company
of five persons between whom there is seldom
more than a canvas partition.</p>

<p>Diane did not stop crying, and Jean still knelt
on the ground looking at her. Presently he
glanced up at François&#8217; grinning face, and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;François, because you never loved a woman,
you don&#8217;t know what it means, to see her
wretched and foolish and crying her eyes out for
a worthless dog, as Diane is doing now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, true, true!&#8221; laughed François, &#8220;I
have done many foolish things in my life, but I
never intend to love any woman, especially
Diane. Ha, ha! Here, take this stage dagger
and kill yourselves like a couple of lovers in
grand opera. It is not much of a weapon, but
it will do the job. It is the only way out of a
three-cornered love affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;François, you are so unfeeling,&#8221; said Diane,
angrily, and drying her eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>As the stage dagger came clattering over the
canvas, François got down off his bucket on the
other side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never loved a woman!&#8221; muttered François
to himself. He had a habit common to imaginative
persons, of talking to himself when he
was under a great stress. &#8220;There they go off
together. I wonder if they have taken the
dagger with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat motionless, gazing into the dingy little
unframed mirror hung against the canvas, apparently
fascinated by the glare in his own
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand on that bucket again, François,
my man,&#8221; he said to himself between his clenched
teeth. &#8220;If the dagger is on the floor&mdash; It is
a clumsy thing, a blunt and horrid weapon
to use on one&#8217;s self.&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain he tried to hold himself by his own
glance into the mirror, as one man tries to cow
another by his gaze. He backed away until
his foot struck the overturned bucket; then he
jumped up and glanced over into Diane&#8217;s dressing-room.
No, there was no dagger on the floor;
there was nothing but the box, which was locked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and a bit of a mirror, a towel and soap, and a
comb and brush. As François looked, his eyes
lost their wild expression. He breathed freely
like a man released from the grip of a wild beast.
He even laughed, and in his excess of relief,
turned a double somersault on the floor, and putting
on his shabby coat and shabbier hat, went
off whistling gaily. As he came out of the narrow,
black alley entrance which did duty for a stage
entrance, he saw the Marquis Egmont de St.
Angel stepping across the street toward the Hotel
Metropole. He had gone through his usual
performance of watching Diane go home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloo! my dear Egmont of the Holy
Angels,&#8221; cried François, &#8220;I will take supper with
you to-night if you will ask me, or if you will pay
for the supper, I won&#8217;t even stand on the asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, then,&#8221; answered the Marquis.
He was willing to pay for François&#8217; supper in
order to talk about Diane.</p>

<p>The Marquis got a table in an alcove of the
pavilion so he could talk freely. The contrast
between the two men was extreme&mdash;the Marquis,
in his splendid dragoon uniform, for he
had just come from a reception at the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the general commanding, and François in his
shabby clothes. The waiters, who knew that
François was a juggler at a cheap place, nevertheless
treated him with an odd kind of respect
due to a note of command which his voice had
never wholly lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to go to a dull reception at the house
of the general,&#8221; said the Marquis when he and
François were seated at a little table, &#8220;and got
away as soon as I could. What a bore are those
pink and white girls, clinging to their mothers&#8217;
skirts and as ignorant as children! They are
quite colorless after Mademoiselle Diane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Diane isn&#8217;t ignorant. She could not well
be,&#8221; replied François, sipping his wine. &#8220;But
in mind she has an eternal innocence. There
is a great difference between the two things&mdash;ignorance
and innocence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; replied the Marquis,
whose mind was low, and who was not so
intelligent as François. &#8220;That capricious little
music hall devil has given me more trouble to
bring around to my way of thinking than half
the girls I have met to-night. But she keeps me
dancing after her, damn her, the little darling!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>François laughed at this, and laughed still
more when the Marquis inquired anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is that great, hulking fellow who
sings and dances with her that frightens her.
Perhaps she is in love with him; women are such
crazy creatures!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; cried François, beginning to attack
the supper which the waiter had brought, &#8220;Diane
is not in love with Jean, nor with me either,
strange to say, although I was born both handsome
and rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis pushed his chair back a little,
and the waiter being out of hearing, brought his
fist down on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;The infernal, proud, presumptuous little
devil probably thinks she can marry me! Very
well, let us see who will beat at that game.
Just look at this impudent note she wrote me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis tore from his breast Diane&#8217;s cool
little note, the only one he had ever had from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t go out to supper after the performance.
She remains with Monsieur and
Madame Grandin, her friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis howled with laughter at this,
and then kept on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8220;And she a singer and dancer in the cheapest
music hall in this dull old town of Bienville!
Oh, she has got it into her silly head that by
holding off she can become a marquise, but she
won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are carrying around her note in your
breast pocket,&#8221; suggested François.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I am fool enough for that,&#8221; calmly
admitted the Marquis, putting the note back
in his breast pocket and drawing his chair up to
the table. &#8220;I can feel it, I can feel it there,
although it is only a bit of paper. Who was her
father, François?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The village hatter,&#8221; replied François, &#8220;like
the father of Adrienne Lecouvreur. That was
her prosperous period, when she enjoyed the
advantages of a polite education at the village
school. Then her parents died, and she was
taken to the house of an uncle who owned three
acres of ground, and Diane worked in the cabbage
garden and tended geese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where did she learn to sing, and all those
devlish, captivating little ways of hers on the
stage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Nature, the mighty mother of us all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
She took some singing lessons from the village
teacher, and used to sing at country fairs after
she was sixteen. Then, a couple of years ago,
we found her and took her into our company.
Singing on the stage was taught her by Jean
Leroux, her partner, and I taught her something
of acting and little stage tricks, but I must say
she was a very apt pupil. She has got it into
her head to go to Paris and study for the grand
opera, but she has no grand opera voice, and has
two hundred and sixty-six francs to pay her
expenses.&#8221; For Diane had palmed off the grand
opera story on François as well as on Jean, when
really her mind was set upon a big music hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything that you tell me,&#8221; said the
Marquis, &#8220;shows how admirably unfitted this
wide mouthed, skinny girl is to become the
Marquise Egmont de St. Angel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have hit upon her name,&#8221; cried François,
laughing, &#8220;for we call her Skinny. Our
little Skinny a marquise! And your title is
worth at least two million francs in the open
market. As for yourself, I may, with the frankness
of a relative, say you would be dear at two
hundred francs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;Has anybody ever told you that you were
extremely impudent, M. le Bourgeois, as you
call yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Occasionally,&#8221; replied François. &#8220;Here,
waiter.&#8221; The waiter came from a distance.
&#8220;Take this chicken away,&#8221; said François,&mdash;&#8220;it
was hatched during the First Empire, I think,&mdash;and
bring us one that isn&#8217;t old enough for military
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis rambled on, admiring and cursing
Diane all through the supper.</p>

<p>When François got home an hour later and
passed Diane&#8217;s door, he saw a thread of light
under it, and the door opened gently, showing
Diane&#8217;s pale, dispirited face. She knew well
enough where François had been; nobody except
the Marquis had so far asked him to supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said François in a whisper, answering
the question in poor Diane&#8217;s eyes, &#8220;I have been
to supper with him. It always raises me in my
own esteem, for I see that I, François le Bourgeois,
born in a chateau, and now juggler and
acrobat when I am sober enough, am a far more
respectable character than the Marquis Egmont
de St. Angel; he has no more brains than my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
shoe, and is the handsomest young officer I ever
saw. I am ashamed of him as a relative.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane slammed the door angrily in François&#8217;
face.</p>

<p>The days and the weeks crept on, and the performances
in the ex-furniture shop maintained
and even increased their popularity. Diane
could have had supper every evening with an
officer or with a young advocate or any of the
gay dogs who are found in every town, but Diane,
being a shrewd little person, concluded that it
was worth more as an advertisement to decline
these offers than to accept them. Soon it became
the subject of numerous wagers among the
gilded youth of Bienville as to who should first
have the triumph of entertaining Diane at
supper. Presently the wagers were changed;
it was a question whether any of them could
succeed in this commendable project.</p>

<p>This sudden popularity of Diane by no means
weakened the devotion of the Marquis de St.
Angel. She still turned an unseeing eye and a
deaf ear toward him, although her heart beat
wildly and her pulses were racing. One person
profited by this&mdash;François. He could get supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
at any time out of the Marquis by merely telling
about Diane, and especially of the notes and
letters she received, and even the presents which
she haughtily returned. The Marquis continued
to pursue her and to damn her for an affected
prude and subtle advertiser, and not half as
handsome as a plenty of other ladies in her profession
who were not so obdurate.</p>

<p>Grandin at first bitterly reproached Diane
for not encouraging the Marquis and the other
young bloods, but in the course of time he came
around to her opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s much better advertising,&#8221; said Diane.
&#8220;If I should go out to supper with one of these
young gentlemen, the box office receipts would
fall off fifty francs at least. And think, Grandin,
how nice it is for you to have all these people
following us and looking at you because you are
my manager.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; replied Grandin. &#8220;I have been photographed,
actually photographed when I appeared
upon the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>One day in midwinter two great honors were
paid the Grandin company of jugglers, acrobats,
and singers. A card was brought up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
little sitting room where Diane and Madame
Grandin were making a suit of stage clothes for
Grandin, who was not only without his coat, but
also <i>sans-culotte</i>. It was a beautiful card inscribed
Captain, the Marquis Egmont de St.
Angel, Twenty-fifth Regiment of Chasseurs.
The two Grandins and Diane were immediately
beside themselves. Diane, who had on a large
white apron, took it off and put it on again,
frantically, and rushed to the little mirror to tidy
her hair when it all came tumbling down her
back in a glorious mass. Grandin tore the pinned-up
jacket and short trousers off and made a dash
for his clothes which Madame Grandin seized
and withheld violently, mistaking them in her
agitation for the stage clothes. In the midst of
the commotion, while the Marquis was cooling
his heels in the narrow passage below, François
passed him and walked upstairs to the little
sitting room.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is downstairs!&#8221; shrieked Diane incoherently,
trying with trembling fingers to put
up her rich hair. &#8220;He is downstairs, and Jean
didn&#8217;t want us to take this sitting room! He
said we didn&#8217;t need it, and now Madame Grandin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
won&#8217;t give Grandin his trousers, and I don&#8217;t
know what I shall do!&#8221;</p>

<p>François, however, with his usual coolness,
knew exactly what to do. He thrust Grandin
into his own room, threw the scissors and the
work things and scraps into Diane&#8217;s apron,
which he gathered up and flung after Grandin,
and going to the top of the stairs called out,
laughing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up, my Marquis Egmont of the Holy
Angels.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis walked in smiling, having heard
all of the commotion. Madame Grandin greeted
him with deep agitation, having never received
a marquis before, as indeed, neither had Diane.</p>

<p>Diane&#8217;s usually pale face was scarlet, and she
sat as demurely as a nun on the edge of her chair,
with downcast eyes, responding &#8220;Yes, m&#8217;sieu,&#8221;
and &#8220;No, m&#8217;sieu&#8221; to the Marquis&#8217; chaste remarks.
François remained so as to keep
Madame Grandin and Diane from a total collapse.
As he looked at the Marquis it occurred
to François that any girl might fall in love with
so splendid an exterior. He was certainly the
most highbred-looking man François had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
seen, not excepting himself. The Marquis&#8217;
undress uniform fitted him to perfection, and
showed the supple beauty of his straight and
sinewy figure. Then his voice was peculiarly
sweet, not big and sonorous like Grandin&#8217;s, but
rather low with a crispness in it like a man accustomed
to giving orders.</p>

<p>They talked about nothings, as people do when
the ladies of a party are not quite at ease. The
Marquis was perfectly at ease, however,
and had a laughing devil in his eye which responded
promptly to the laughing devil in the
eyes of François. Diane&#8217;s voice was ever
peculiarly sweet, and it occurred to François
that the talk between her and the Marquis was
like a duet of birds in spring, or the rich notes
of the &#8217;cello blending with the sharp sweetness
of the violin. And they were just the right
height, and Diane was dark-eyed and black-haired
and white-skinned, while the Marquis
was chestnut-haired and blond and bronzed.</p>

<p>The Marquis complained gently to Diane that
she would never accept his invitations to supper,
and asked her if she would do him the honor to
sup with him that night, when he hoped also to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have the company of Monsieur and Madame
Grandin and Monsieur le Bourgeois.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, no,&#8221; replied Diane sweetly. &#8220;I
made a resolution before we came to Bienville
not to accept any invitations to supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Diane!&#8221; burst out the excellent and
too truthful Madame Grandin, &#8220;you did no such
thing. You only took the notion after you got
here, and besides, you were never asked to supper
before by a marquis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made the resolution in my own mind,&#8221;
replied Diane suavely, who had never dreamed
of such a thing in her life. &#8220;It is most kind of
the Marquis, but I can make no exception.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis protested, backed up not only by
Madame Grandin, but by Grandin himself,
who was listening attentively at the door behind
the Marquis, and put out his head, grimacing and
gesticulating wildly in protest to Diane. The
Marquis saw it all in the little mirror, and burst
out laughing, at which Grandin&#8217;s head suddenly
disappeared. But Diane was relentless, and
the Marquis had to leave, asking permission,
however, to call again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may call every day,&#8221; replied Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Grandin. &#8220;My husband thinks it would be a
very good thing for the show to have a marquis
attentive to Diane. She is a perfectly good
girl, I assure you. We made inquiries about her
character before we engaged her.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Marquis and François were out in
the street and laughing together, François said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware of Diane! She is the most determined
creature I ever saw in my life. If she
makes up her mind to marry you, you are lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>François then walked off, taking his way past
the Bishop&#8217;s palace, a shabby old stone house
with wide iron gates before it. The Bishop was
just coming out for his daily walk, and François,
who was as bold with a bishop as with a rat-catcher,
went up and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I perceive your Grace does not recognise me.
I am&mdash;or I was&mdash;François d&#8217;Artignac of the
Chateau d&#8217;Artignac on the upper Loire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop, a gentle, unsophisticated man,
overflowing with benevolence, shook hands
cordially with François, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is a great pleasure to me to meet one
of your family, for I and my brother, General
Bion, were both born and reared upon that estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
where our father and our grandfather and
our great-grandfathers for many generations back
were laborers. We do not seek to disguise our
humble origin, my brother and I. We were
always well treated by the family of d&#8217;Artignac
as far back as we can remember, and I am happy
and proud to meet a representative of that
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop was now out of the gate, and
François and himself were promenading together
along the street, one of the best in the little town.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember you and your brother well,&#8221;
answered François. &#8220;You were always reading
and improving yourselves, and taking all the
prizes in the village school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did our best,&#8221; replied the Bishop modestly.
&#8220;But I recollect you, the little François,
the beautiful boy in dainty clothes, that used to
walk in the meadows with a footman behind you,
while my brother and I kept the cows. Oh,
they were happy days!&#8221;</p>

<p>François, by design, led the Bishop directly
past the lodgings of the Grandin company, and
looking up at the window, saw the noses of Grandin
and his wife and Diane glued to the window-pane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
They also passed Jean, who bowed
respectfully to the Bishop and then thrust his
tongue in his cheek on the sly to François.</p>

<p>Meanwhile François had told a pretty story
of his downfall in the world, and his resolute
determination to earn a living when he had lost
all his property and had been repudiated by his
family. He did not mention various little
episodes with regard to raising money through
means prohibited by the law, drunkenness, and
a few other shortcomings. He gave as a reason
for his change of name the desire to spare the
noble house of d&#8217;Artignac the mortification of
such a fall.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the Hotel Metropole they met
General Bion, a stiff, discerning person, who
had a low opinion of his brother the Bishop&#8217;s
insight into human nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said the Bishop, &#8220;here is an old
acquaintance of ours in our boyhood. We could
not call him a friend, because he was so far above
us in position, being of the house of d&#8217;Artignac.
He has had many misfortunes which give him
only greater claim upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Bion looked suspiciously at François,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with a dim recollection of having heard that
François&#8217; family had never been proud of him.
His greeting, therefore, was rather cool, although
being a man of sense he promptly referred to
the fact that his father had been a laborer upon
the estate of François&#8217; father.</p>

<p>&#8220;He calls himself Le Bourgeois now, for his
stage name,&#8221; said the good Bishop. &#8220;I think
he shows a true spirit of Christian humility.&#8221;</p>

<p>The General made no response to this, which
caused the Bishop to show François the greater
kindness, asking him to breakfast the next
morning, which François promptly accepted.</p>

<p>When François returned to his lodgings, the
story of his grandeur had already preceded him,
and all his fellow-players, except Jean, were
overcome with the magnificence which was being
showered upon them. Jean said good-humoredly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, François, don&#8217;t play any tricks on the
good old Bishop. He is as innocent as a lamb,
and it would be a sin to trick him.&#8221;</p>

<p>François took no offence at this, whatever.</p>

<p>But François was not the only one of them who
walked that day with a distinguished person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
In the late afternoon, although the day had
grown dark and a brown fog was creeping up
from the river and the low-lying meadows, Diane
went for the walk which she religiously consecrated
to her complexion. She took her way
past the Bishop&#8217;s palace through the best quarter
of the town, indulging herself in dreams of the
time when she would be the mistress of a mansion
like the big stone houses, with gardens in
front, in which the aristocracy of Bienville resided.
Presently she came to the gates of the
park, which she entered. It was so quiet and
so deserted by the nursemaids and the children,
because of the damp and the fog, that Diane
could think uninterruptedly of the Marquis.
The great clumps of evergreen shrubbery loomed
large in the dimness of the fog, and the bare
trees were lost in the mist. Diane entered a
little heart-shaped maze of cedars, cut flat, and
towering high over her head on each side. Here
indeed was solitude; not a sound from the
near-by town broke the silence, and the darkness,
which was not the darkness of night, was like
that of another world. She threaded the winding
paths quickly and presently found herself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the heart of the maze, and sat down on an iron
bench. Then, to shut out the world more completely,
that she might think only of the Marquis,
she put up her muff to her eyes.</p>

<p>As she sat lost in a delicious reverie, she felt
two strong hands taking her own two hands
and removing them gently from her face. It
was the Marquis, who was so close to her that
even in the pearly mist she could distinguish his
face. Never had he looked so handsome to
Diane. His military cap was set jauntily over
his laughing eyes, and his trim, soldierly figure,
with his cavalry cloak hanging over one shoulder,
was grace itself.</p>

<p>Poor Diane!</p>

<p>Having taken her hands from her face, the
Marquis laid his mustache on Diane&#8217;s red lips
in a long and clinging kiss, and then sat down
beside her, drawing her trembling and palpitating
close to him. It was like a bird in the
snare of the fowler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you and followed you,&#8221; he said after
a while. &#8220;You cannot escape me; but why are
you so cruel to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I must be,&#8221; answered poor Diane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
trembling more and more. &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s past
is known some time or other, and when the time
comes that the newspaper reporters begin to
ask about me, I don&#8217;t want to have anything
ugly in my past.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, the Marquis, who knew much about
women, laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is always the way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
women think much more of your reputation than
you do of your virtue. No woman kills herself
because she has yielded to her lover. It is only
one of three things that drives her to suicide
afterward. The first is the dread of being found
out; the second is to be deserted; and the third
is starvation. But there is no record of any
woman killing herself for the mere loss of her
virtue, which shows that modesty is more highly
valued than virtue by women themselves. Is
that not true?&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane looked at him bewildered. Was it true?</p>

<p>&#8220;All I know is,&#8221; she said obstinately, &#8220;that
I don&#8217;t intend there shall be anything in my past
that anybody can twit me about. I would rather
die. You may call it either modesty or virtue,
but it is stronger with me than life or death.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>The Marquis looked at her curiously, and saw
in her eyes that peculiar, deadly obstinacy and
resolution which was Diane&#8217;s strongest characteristic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I once read in a book,&#8221; kept on Diane,
holding off a little from Egmont, &#8220;that the first
time a certain royal prince saw Rachel Felix act,
he wrote something on a card&mdash;I am ashamed
to tell you what it was&mdash;and sent it to her
back of the stage, and she laughed, and invited
him to come to see her. If I had been in her
place, I would have killed him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Killing is rather difficult for a woman,&#8221;
replied the Marquis, laughing a little uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Diane rose and stood before him, and seemed
to grow taller as she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;God would have shown me the way,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Jael had only a nail, but she killed the
enemy of her people, and Judith cut off the
head of Holofernes, in his camp, surrounded by
his guards.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light in Diane&#8217;s eyes startled the Marquis.
But it melted into a dovelike softness, when
Egmont drew her once more to his side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you adorable little
devil, that you want to bully me into marrying
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Diane, &#8220;I am so much in love
with you that I don&#8217;t want to bully you into
anything; only it is marriage or nothing. I
don&#8217;t know why I say this, or feel this, but I tell
you it is as fixed as the stars. You have a
power over me so far and no farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane, as she said this, laid her head contentedly
on the Marquis&#8217; shoulder, and his lips
sought hers.</p>

<p>And so half an hour passed in the reproaches
and confessions of the woman who loves and the
man who pretends he loves. The mist was
growing colder and more dense. It was as if
they were alone in a white, mysterious, soundless
world inhabited only by themselves.</p>

<p>Presently, as Diane lay on the Marquis&#8217; breast,
there sounded afar off the faint echo of a church
bell from the other world which they had forgotten.
At the sound, Diane suddenly and
violently wrenched herself from the Marquis&#8217;
arms and stood upon her feet. Two thoughts
raced through her mind, one equally as important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
as the other. The first was the reproach
of the church bell that she had allowed the Marquis
to kiss her lips and put his arm about her.
And the second was the iron discipline of the
stage which drags men and women apart when
it seems like the tearing of a heart in two; which
calls them from death-beds; which makes them
report at the theatre when they are more dead
than alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the cathedral bell,&#8221; cried Diane in
a choking voice, &#8220;and it tells me that I have
been a wicked girl, and that I may be late for
the performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis stood up too, laughing at the
jumble of ideas in Diane&#8217;s mind, but the next
moment she was gone, speeding in and out of the
maze. In her agitation and the white gloom of
the mist she lost her way, and the Marquis,
following her, though unable to find her, could
hear her sobbing on the other side of the hedge
as she ran wildly about trying to find the outlet.
At last, however, she escaped and was in the
open path running toward the park gates.</p>

<p>The Marquis took his way leisurely after her,
not smiling like a successful lover, but grinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his teeth and cursing both her and himself.
Was it possible that this presumptuous, impudent
little creature meant to force him to marry
her?</p>

<p>Diane got back to her lodging in time for
supper with the Grandins, Jean, and François.
François amused and delighted them all, telling
them of his interview with the Bishop.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; François said, &#8220;I shall be
breakfasting in distinguished company, with the
Bishop. He asked me, and I accepted, you
may depend upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an advertisement!&#8221; cried Grandin,
with an eye to business. &#8220;If only you could
manage to get it into the newspapers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he wouldn&#8217;t be asked to the palace any
more,&#8221; responded the practical Jean. &#8220;There is
a limit to advertising, Grandin, which you never
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could say,&#8221; said Grandin, meditating,
&#8220;that François was passing the Bishop&#8217;s palace
and fell down and hurt himself, and was taken
within by the Bishop&#8217;s servants. Anything
will do, just to have it known that François has
been at the palace.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Grandin!&#8221; cried Madame Grandin,
&#8220;how can you invent such lies?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all so interested in the story of
François and his grand acquaintances, that no
one except Jean noticed how silent Diane was,
and that she ate no supper, although her appetite
was usually remarkably good. Jean saw
that something had happened, but mindful of
that extraordinary loyalty to art of which the
theatrical profession is the great model, forebore
to ask, lest he should agitate her more.</p>

<p>As Diane and Jean were always partners, they
invariably had a love scene in whatever they
played together. To-night Diane played the
love scene very badly, so badly that the audience
noticed it, and she got very little applause.
That waked her up, and she picked up her part,
as it were, and played it with a renewed spirit
that put the audience once more into a good
humor with her.</p>

<p>When the performance was over, Diane was a
long time in dressing to go home, and the Grandins
and François had already gone. Jean, in
his shabby, every-day clothes, was waiting for
her at the stage entrance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>&#8220;I am glad you took yourself by the throat,&#8221;
he said to her grimly, as they picked their way
through the mist which still hung over the town,
in which the gas lamps made only a little yellow
ring. &#8220;I thought the scene was gone at one
moment, and expected you to be hissed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried Diane, for once thoroughly
frightened. &#8220;But Jean, I hate love scenes on the
stage.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE SPLENDID EVENTS THAT HAPPENED AT
BIENVILLE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day François duly presented himself
at the palace at twelve o&#8217;clock for breakfast
with the Bishop. Much to his disgust, the
General was present. François, who loved to
fool people, assumed an air and tone of extreme
virtue, and again told, with many additions, a
pretty story of his reverses and his determination
to earn an honest living by doing juggling
and acrobating, the only things he knew how to
do by which a franc could be earned. The good
Bishop was lost in admiration of François, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That, my dear M. le Bourgeois, as you call
yourself, is the highest form of virtue and respectability,
is it not, my brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>General Bion maintained a stiff silence, which
annoyed the good Bishop exceedingly.</p>

<p>The General meant to sit François out, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
doubting that he would contrive to borrow a
small sum of money from the Bishop before
leaving. But François held his ground, as his
ancestors had held theirs on many a hard-fought
field, and the General, called away by his military
duties, had to leave the wolf in conversation
with the lamb. He left a deputy, however,
in the person of Mathilde, the Bishop&#8217;s housekeeper,
an angular and ferocious person of sixty,
who disapproved of the Bishop&#8217;s fondness for
picking up stray acquaintances and lost dogs and
cats and giving them the hospitality of the palace.</p>

<p>When François and the Bishop were left alone
in the Bishop&#8217;s study, then François laid himself
out to amuse his host. Soon he had the Bishop
roaring with laughter over jokes and merry
stories, and at two o&#8217;clock it was as much as
François could do to tear himself away.</p>

<p>By the time he was out of the room Mathilde
had stalked in and proceeded to give the Bishop
a piece of her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does your Grace remember,&#8221; she asked
wrathfully, &#8220;the last adventurer your Grace
took up with, who borrowed ninety francs of
your Grace and then skipped off to Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, my good Mathilde, I know,&#8221; responded
the Bishop, using a soft answer to turn away
wrath. &#8220;But this gentleman, you see&mdash;for he is
a gentleman&mdash;belongs to a family which were
exceedingly kind to my family, and especially
my father. He was a laborer upon the estates
of this gentleman&#8217;s father. Think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows,&#8221; cried Mathilde, &#8220;what a good-for-nothing
scamp he must have been. Who
ever saw a gentleman standing on his head, like
this fellow does, and playing tricks with cards?
I kept my hand upon my purse in my pocket all
the time I was serving the General and your
Grace and this ragamuffin at breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mathilde,&#8221; said the Bishop, trying to be
stern, &#8220;I cannot permit you to call a guest in
my house a ragamuffin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; cried Mathilde, &#8220;I will give him his
right name, and call him a rapscallion!&#8221; And
then she flounced out of the room, banging the
door after her.</p>

<p>The Bishop sighed. He was a celibate, and
yet he was henpecked worse than any man in
Bienville.</p>

<p>François, listening outside, walked away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
laughing and resolving to pay off Mathilde for
knowing the truth about him.</p>

<p>Two days after that, François again met the
Bishop face to face in the street in front of the
palace, and was warmly greeted. François,
eying the clock in the cathedral steeple, saw that
it was ten minutes of twelve, and remembering
the history of Scheherezade and the Arabian
Nights, began telling his crack story to the
Bishop. In the midst of it came the bells announcing
noon, and the odor of broiled chops
from the kitchen window of the old stone house
known as the palace. The Bishop, like other
men, was subject to temptation, and he could
not do without the end of the story, and besides
he had always that excellent excuse that his
father had been a laborer upon the estates of
François&#8217; father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said the Bishop, &#8220;and have breakfast
with me. My brother will not be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; replied François. &#8220;Now, if you
could get rid of that old battleaxe of a housekeeper
while we are at breakfast, it would be
better still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can&#8217;t do,&#8221; said the Bishop ruefully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
&#8220;But after all, she is a good creature, and my
brother, the General, says it if were not for
Mathilde I would never have a sous in my pocket
or a coat to my back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is probably right,&#8221; answered François,
taking the Bishop by the arm as they marched
up the steps. &#8220;It is your cursed good nature
that will always be giving you trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>François&#8217; reception at the hands of Mathilde
was a trifle more hostile than before.</p>

<p>There are some tricks of legerdemain which
can be played without the aid of a confederate.
In the midst of the breakfast, while François
was telling some of his best stories, the Bishop
inadvertently took his purse from his pocket
with his handkerchief, and left the purse lying
on the table. When breakfast was over, the
purse was missing.</p>

<p>Mathilde assumed an air of triumph, and the
Bishop looked very sheepish. At once a search
wits begun, Mathilde shaking the cloth, looking
under the chair occupied by François, and doing
everything except rifling his pockets. The purse
contained eighty francs, a large sum for the
poor Bishop, who lived from hand to mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
In the hunt the dining room soon looked as if a
cyclone had struck it; drawers were pulled open,
chairs knocked about, and Mathilde watched
François with a hawk&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a good bit of money to let lie around
in the presence of a servant,&#8221; said François,
impudently. &#8220;Come now, you woman, haven&#8217;t
you got that purse in your pocket this moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mathilde, furious, thrust her hand into her
own pocket where she carried a handkerchief,
a notebook, a large bunch of keys, a prayer-book,
a rosary, and a little figure of St. Joseph in a tin
case, and her own purse. But what she brought
out of her pocket was the Bishop&#8217;s purse. The
Bishop laughed long and loud, and François
laughed louder than the Bishop.</p>

<p>After this was over, the Bishop invited
François into the study. François, in addition
to telling some of his best stories, proceeded to
go through some of his most comic antics. The
good Bishop laughed until he cried, and excused
himself on that ever excellent plea about his
father being a laborer on the estates of François&#8217;
father. Then François went to a wheezy old
piano in the room and began to play and sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
some simple old songs of the Bishop&#8217;s youth&mdash;the
songs his mother had sung to him in the
laborer&#8217;s cottage in the meadows. Presently
the tears were trickling down the Bishop&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, M. le Bourgeois,&#8221; he said tremulously.
&#8220;I love those simple old airs that take
me back to my childhood when my good mother
worked for us all day, and then had the heart to
sing to us in the evening. As you sing, I can
hear in my heart the tinkling of the cow-bells
and the sharp little cries of the birds under the
thatched roof&mdash;for our roof was only thatch,
you remember. Oh, my mother, my dear, dear
mother! Her hands were hard with toil, her
back was bent with hanging over washing-tubs
and the soup pot on the fire; but in Heaven I
know she is straight and soft of hand, and one
day all her children will surround her and pay
her homage as if she, the peasant mother, were a
queen!&#8221;</p>

<p>François continued to play soft chords, the
Bishop listening and sighing and smiling. Presently
François heard from the Bishop&#8217;s big
chair a gentle snore. Then François, rising
noiselessly, pulled off his own shoes, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
cracked, and with professional sleight-of-hand
took off the Bishop&#8217;s new shoes, which he put on
his own feet, and then slipped his own shoes on
the Bishop&#8217;s feet. There was a desk in the room,
and François scribbled on a piece of paper, &#8220;I
would have taken your Grace&#8217;s stockings, but
they are cotton. If I were a bishop, I would wear
silk stockings. I hope your Grace will remedy
this impropriety, and in the future wear silk
stockings worth the taking.&#8221; This scrap of
paper he pinned to the Bishop&#8217;s cassock, and
went softly out through a door opening on a balcony,
from which he swung himself down into the
garden. As he walked along, he saw a row of
beehives on a bench. Stepping gently, he took
off his coat and threw it over a beehive, and then
lifting it carried it out into the street. A policeman
stopped him, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got there, my man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A beehive,&#8221; replied François, &#8220;just out of a
hothouse, and the bees very active.&#8221;</p>

<p>The policeman suddenly backed off, and François
marched away with his beehive, which he
subsequently threw over the stone wall around
the Bishop&#8217;s garden.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Meanwhile the Bishop waked, and reading
the piece of paper, looked down at his feet to
find full confirmation of François&#8217; words. In
the midst of it, Mathilde tore into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, your Grace,&#8221; bawled Mathilde, &#8220;what
does your Grace think of your rowdy friend now?
He stole a beehive off the bench as he went by.
Pierre, the cobbler&#8217;s boy, was passing and saw
him and told the cook who told the footman
who told me, and I went out, and the beehive is
gone! And look at your Grace&#8217;s feet! The
wretch actually stole your Grace&#8217;s shoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you speak with such violence?&#8221;
said the Bishop, loath to lose, for a single pair of
shoes and a beehive, the joy of François&#8217; company.
&#8220;Suppose I meet a man whom I have
known as a boy, when I was in very humble
circumstances and he was very high up in the
world, and suppose that man&#8217;s shoes are worn,
and I choose to give him a good pair and take his
in return? Is that anybody&#8217;s business except
my own? And suppose I gave him the beehive
by way of a joke, you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be exactly like your Grace,&#8221;
snapped Mathilde. &#8220;But it was the only good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
pair of shoes your Grace had in the world, and
I shall have to go out into the town immediately
to buy your Grace another pair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said the Bishop, delighted to get rid of
Mathilde on any terms.</p>

<p>When the door had slammed after the excellent
Mathilde, the Bishop drew a long sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not tell a single lie,&#8221; he said to himself;
&#8220;I merely stated a hypothetical case. After
all, the poor fellow needed the shoes, and he
turned it into a pleasantry. I owed him that
much for the hearty laughs he gave me, and for
singing my mother&#8217;s old songs to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop was always meeting François in
the street after that; it was as if François were
lying in wait for him, and by the simple expedient
of beginning a good story, or intimating that
he had a merry song, just as they reached the
gates of the Bishop&#8217;s palace, François could always
get a meal.</p>

<p>The affair of the purse had made Mathilde
his mortal enemy, and she complained to the
General that the Bishop was giving scandal by
having that acrobat and juggler, François<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
What&#8217;s-his-name, to breakfast at the palace
about three times a week. General Bion, who
was punctilious beyond any maiden lady in
Bienville, felt it his duty to remonstrate with
his brother about having François so often at
the palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my brother,&#8221; mildly urged the Bishop,
&#8220;you would not have me, the son of our father,
a laborer, uppish to the son of the Count d&#8217;Artignac.
And besides, François has a good heart,
and I am trying to bring him to penitence and
to leave his present uncertain mode of life and
to settle down somewhere. I think he is very
amenable to grace, and I shall succeed in doing
much with him. And then, he sings to me the
songs our mother sang&mdash;ah, me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The General was silenced for the time, but
Mathilde gave him privately some valuable information.
It was true that whenever she came
into the study François was always talking
about his soul, and his desire to repent. But
as soon as her back was turned she could hear
sounds of laughter&mdash;François was none too
good to be laughing at her&mdash;and sometimes she
thought she heard the patter of feet, like dancing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
It could not be his Grace. If the General could
pay an unexpected call some day after François
had breakfasted at the palace&mdash;</p>

<p>The General took the hint, and one day when
he had seen François going into the palace arm
in arm with the Bishop, the General bided his
time. When he knew breakfast was over, he
unceremoniously opened the door of the Bishop&#8217;s
study. Mathilde was close behind him. There
sat the Bishop in his great arm-chair, his hands
crossed upon his waistcoat his mouth open as
if it were on hinges, while François, in a ballet
costume improvised from a table-cloth, was
doing a beautiful skirt dance and carolling at the
top of his lungs one of the gayest of the music
hall songs. The entrance of the General was
like a paralytic shock. The Bishop forgot to
close his mouth, and François stood with one
leg in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, brother,&#8221; said General Bion
sarcastically. &#8220;So this is bringing M. le Bourgeois
to penitence and reforming his wandering
life. I am afraid he is laying up material for
you as a penitent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor Bishop knew not where to look nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
what to say, but François, with unblushing impudence,
ran behind the General, caught Mathilde
in his arms, and proceeded to do a high
kicking waltz with her, in spite of her screams
and protests and fighting like a tiger. Not even
the General could stand that with gravity; he
laughed in spite of himself. After that day,
when François breakfasted at the palace the
General had a way of dropping in, and there
would be an audience of two instead of one to the
antics of François in the good Bishop&#8217;s study.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, things went on in the lodgings
opposite the Hotel Metropole without the slightest
change. The Marquis still haunted the
place, and Diane still gave him rare interviews
in the presence of Madame Grandin. François
chaffed her unmercifully about this prudery,
but Jean encouraged her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that man see you alone,&#8221; said
Jean sternly to Diane. &#8220;A marquis and a cheap
music-hall singer is a bad combination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is because you are jealous, Jean,&#8221; said
Diane frankly, at which Jean looked at her with
an expression so piteous, so heartrending, in his
honest eyes, that even Diane was touched.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>One afternoon about three weeks after Diane&#8217;s
adventure in the maze with the Marquis, it was
the same sort of an afternoon, the white fog
from the river enveloping the town like a muslin
veil, and making a mysterious light that was
neither day nor night, darkness nor light.</p>

<p>Diane, on going out for her walk, determined
to live over that hour of tumultuous joy in the
maze, to indulge her imagination in the notion
that there she should meet the Marquis. She
started out, therefore, tripping lightly along,
and made straight for the park. Once more
she entered the wide driveway, half veiled in the
floating white mist, and with an unerring instinct,
she found the opening to the maze. As she
walked between the tall, green walls of the clipped
cedars, she felt a hand laid on her shoulder, and
looking up, there was Egmont, his military cap
sitting, as ever, jauntily on his handsome head,
his cavalry cloak draped about him like the
mantle of a young Greek.</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught sight of you as you came out of the
house, and I followed you here. Don&#8217;t you
suppose that I have lived over in imagination
the half-hour we spent in this place? And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
think how tantalizing it is to sit up in that stuffy
room and talk to you across the table in the presence
of that silly creature, Madame Grandin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t silly, she is one of the best women-jugglers
in the profession,&#8221; answered Diane,
loyal and illogical as ever.</p>

<p>There was no resisting him on the part of poor
Diane, and presently they were sitting on the
bench together, Diane&#8217;s soft, cool cheek resting
against the Marquis&#8217; mustache. Presently
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what do you suppose I followed you
here for, besides these sweet kisses? Your obstinacy
has conquered at last. Will you be my
wife, Diane?&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane gave a great gasp, and before Egmont
knew what she was doing, she had slipped to the
damp ground and was kneeling against him,
weeping and laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean it? Do you really mean it?&#8221;
she was crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I mean it,&#8221; said the Marquis, lifting
her up once more on the bench beside him.
&#8220;You are one of those women, Diane, who can
make their own terms with men.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&#8220;I will never be the least trouble to you,&#8221;
said Diane, still weeping; &#8220;I never will be in
your way; I will never utter a complaint. I
know what it means for you, but I will efface
myself. I will go to live in a hovel in the country
if you like. All I ask is a little love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you shall have,&#8221; said the Marquis,
kissing her red lips. &#8220;Not a little, but an immense
deal. And as for living in the country,
it is quite true, Diane, that you would be happier
and better off living quietly and out of sight for
a while, until you learn how to be a marquise.
I am thirty years old, and I have no family, so
there is no one to protest. The chateau of
Egmont is leased, because, to tell you the truth,
Diane, I am a poor man. But I have a little
shooting-box an hour from Bienville where you
could live very comfortably, eh, Diane? A little
box of a house with a garden and lilac hedges
around it, and a summer-house and some trees
and fields and a little river where I often go to fish
when I am off duty. Now if you were there&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prospect was so dazzling to Diane that
she had to close her eyes to see the splendid
vision, and her lips could only whisper:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8220;A summer-house, a lilac hedge! Oh, glory,
glory! One maid will be enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>When her first rapture of gratitude and joy
was over, Diane, ever practical, said trembling:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am willing to live quietly and never to
bother you, but I want my people, the Grandins
and François and Jean, to know that I am really
married to you. I could not live&mdash;I could not
live, if they don&#8217;t know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; answered the Marquis readily.
&#8220;You see, I really belong in the district where
the shooting-box lies. My Colonel will ask me
questions, for an officer can&#8217;t get married on
the sly, but trust me to manage that. Let me
see, I can get three days&#8217; leave three weeks from
to-day; this is Saturday. You and I and Madame
Grandin can go to the little place and the
civil and religious ceremonies can both be performed
the same day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And M. Grandin and François and Jean can
go too?&#8221; asked Diane anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; replied Egmont. &#8220;Grandin
will be certain to talk too much in that
rumbling big voice of his, and create remark.
As for François and that great, hulking Jean, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
object to them decidedly. You will need two
witnesses. Madame Grandin is one, and I can
find another at my place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane remained silent; a great lump was
rising in her throat. But the idea came into her
mind, &#8220;This is the first thing he has asked me.
Shall I refuse him and make it unpleasant for
him when he is doing me the greatest honor in
the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>They remained sitting on the bench and exchanging
the sweet nothings of lovers until the
faint sound of the church bell again startled
Diane, when, as before, she rose and ran panting
through the park and along the streets until she
reached the lodgings. Once more she found
them all at supper, and, as before, she sat pale
and silent and eating no supper, but her eyes
were glorified. Jean looked at her with a heavy
heart; he knew without telling that she had
seen the Marquis.</p>

<p>When supper was over, the table cleared away,
and they were about starting for the little music
hall, Diane, looking about her, said in her most
dramatic manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, all of you. I said I knew something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
splendid would befall me in Bienville. It has
come this afternoon. The Marquis Egmont de
St. Angel asked me to marry him, to become his
wife, to be a marquise. Oh, how glad I was!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Grandin clasped Diane in her arms,
while Grandin sank on a chair overwhelmed
with the magnificence of the thing. Neither
Jean nor François spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall maintain a dignified silence with
the reporters,&#8221; said Grandin, &#8220;and refuse to
say a word upon the subject of whether Diane
is to marry the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel
or not. But I shall meanwhile write a circumstantial
account of everything, mentioning all
our names as frequently as possible, and send
it to all the Paris newspapers, anonymously
of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>François threw himself back in another chair
and laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always said, Skinny,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that you
were the most obstinate, pig-headed, impudent,
determined creature that was ever on this
planet. Here you have actually bullied a
marquis into making you an offer of marriage!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Jean, almost as pale as Diane, spoke composedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you happiness, Diane,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Now, tell us all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to be married this day three weeks,&#8221;
said Diane. &#8220;When I think of it I am so happy
I feel as if I could fly. The Marquis has a
little shooting-box an hour from here, and we
are to drive there, the Marquis and I and Madame
Grandin. She will be one of my witnesses,
and the Marquis will provide the other. The
civil and religious ceremonies will both take
place the same day. The Marquis says his
colonel will take a hand in the business, but
that he can manage that.&#8221;</p>

<p>A slight chill fell upon all present. Diane,
realizing it, blushed and felt every inch a traitor.
Then Jean spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me, Diane,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you
ought to have some man friend with you,
M. Grandin, for example. Not that <i>I</i> wish
to go. Oh, no, not for a moment!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Jean said these words, his strong, clean-shaven
face was distorted for an instant.
Everybody knew that he least of any one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the world wished to see Diane married to another
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diane is a quick study,&#8221; said François,
laughing, &#8220;but it will take her all of three weeks
to learn her part as a marquise. It is the best
joke I ever heard&mdash;a joke on her, and on my
cousin the Marquis, and on all of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I left it all to him,&#8221; said Diane, bursting
into tears. &#8220;I could not find fault with him when
he was doing me the greatest honor in the
world, and he a marquis. And then,&#8221; she continued,
recovering herself and speaking boldly,
&#8220;I am as good as twelve men and a boy, anyhow
to take care of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; broke in Madame Grandin,
cheerfully. &#8220;Marquises have their own
way of doing things quite different from people
like ourselves. The thing is, now, to get some
one in Diane&#8217;s place and rehearse her so she
can appear this night three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Diane wept afresh. There was a
strange shock in the thought of some one else
in her place; she began to realize the tremendous
dislocation of her life which was coming. This
feeling grew upon her as she entered the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
music hall, and she acted her part with extraordinary
power, born of her beating heart, the
tension of her soul.</p>

<p>When the performance was over, and she was
putting on her hat in the little canvas den, she
found herself trembling and weeping a little,
and called to Jean in the next den, and he came
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jean!&#8221; she said, &#8220;think, in three weeks
it will be the last time that I shall ever step
upon the stage again! It will be the last time
that I shall ever see those hundreds of eyes full
of interest in me, and good will! It will be the
last time that I shall make up and wear funny
little short skirts, showing my ankles that are
so nice! And I do so love to show my ankles!
And it will be the last time that I shall ever see
any of you as Diane, your fellow-player! After
that, I shall be a marquise, the happiest person
in the world, no doubt, but I shall never feel
quite at ease with any of you again. I shall
always be watching and thinking that I am
being too kind to you or not kind enough. Oh,
Jean!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Diane did a strange thing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
happiest person in the world; she burst into
a passion of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough to make you cry,&#8221; answered
Jean stolidly. &#8220;You are being removed from
one world into another. In our stage world
everything goes right, and the villain is always
punished before the curtain comes down.
That&#8217;s why it is the theatre is a necessity of
life; it represents the ideal world where the
sinner always repents and is forgiven, and where
lovers are always united in the end, and where
the scoundrel is paid in full. We, who live in
this ideal world, find the real world very dull
in comparison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why, I suppose, I feel so badly about
leaving the stage. But I never thought of
anything to-day, when I felt Egmont&#8217;s arms
around me and his lips were upon mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean gave a strangled cry, and sat down
heavily on the box which was the only seat
in the little den.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man can&#8217;t stand everything, Diane!&#8221;
he cried desperately. &#8220;In the name of God,
don&#8217;t tell me anything more like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t take it so hard, Jean,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Diane, drying her eyes. &#8220;After all, I am only
one woman out of millions and millions of them,
and you are so nice and so good and act and sing
so well, I am sure you could marry some girl
much higher up in the profession than I am.
And then, everybody has a thorn in the heart.
Come, let us start home. The Marquis does
not need to dog my steps now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grandins had already left, and Diane
walked home between François, who joined
them outside, and Jean. François called her
Madame la Marquise, and made all sorts of good-natured
fun of her. Jean was glum and silent.</p>

<p>When the two men parted with Diane on the
landing and went up to their garret, their beds
separated only with a canvas curtain, François
slapped Jean on the back, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, old man! It&#8217;s easy enough
to forget a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean turned on François a look of contempt.</p>

<p>Jean undressed quickly and laid down upon
his hard bed, but not to sleep. He would not
give François a chance to gibe at him next day
about a sleepless night, and so lay rigidly still
in the blackness of the long, low-ceiled garret.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>He knew when it was one o&#8217;clock by the sound
across the street of the closing of the Hotel
Metropole, the banging of shutters, and the
barring of gates. By some strange psychic
intimation he knew that François, although
perfectly quiet, was as wide awake as he.
Presently, he heard strange sounds from the
other side of the canvas partition, something
like suppressed sobs and groans. Jean, thinking
François was ill, drew aside a corner of the
canvas at the end. François was huddled in a
heap on the floor, clasping his knees and rocking
back and forth, while strangled sobs and
smothered cries burst from him. Jean, abashed,
returned to his own bed.</p>

<p>The next morning, a bouquet of roses and a
little note arrived from the Marquis. This
gave unalloyed happiness to two persons&mdash;Diane
and Grandin.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bouquet for a lady in my company from
a marquis!&#8221; cried Grandin. &#8220;It&#8217;s enough to
make a man mad with joy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before breakfast Diane sallied forth, and
came back bringing a book on etiquette which
she immediately proceeded to study diligently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>When they all assembled for the twelve
o&#8217;clock dinner, Diane could scarcely be torn
away from her book.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said to the assembled table,
&#8220;I have got to learn how to behave like a marquise&mdash;and
all in three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> behave like a marquise!&#8221; said Jean,
somewhat rudely, and laughing. &#8220;You will
be about as comfortable as a mackerel in a
gravel walk! Excuse me, Diane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will excuse you,&#8221; said Diane, serenely.
&#8220;You have been so good to me for so long, and
now I have but eighteen more performances
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips trembled a little at this, but she
quickly resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;The book says that a girl must never see
her fiancé alone, and a fiancé should not call
oftener than twice a week. That I shall
arrange, and Madame Grandin will stay
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, even Jean laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about your trousseau, my dear?&#8221;
asked François, &#8220;especially your court costumes?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8220;That will have to come later,&#8221; replied
Diane. &#8220;I shall be so busy seeing the Marquis,
and studying up this book, and trying to help
you with the new girl that I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have time to
get a regular trousseau. Besides, I don&#8217;t want
to spend as much as three hundred and four
francs, which I have now, in a hurry. It is
a great deal of money, and I must think over
it and look well about before I spend it. I have
my nice white muslin trimmed with lace at
fifteen sous the yard, and I can wash and iron
it so beautifully it will look like new. I shall
be obliged to buy a wedding veil and wreath,
but, by looking around a little, I think I can
get one for five or six francs. How amusing
it will be when I am a marquise thinking about
these things!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandin set on foot plans to secure a young
lady in Diane&#8217;s place. In this, he was immediately
rewarded, and succeeded in getting
Mademoiselle Rose le Roi, as she called herself,
a strapping young woman, blonde and beautiful,
and as tall as Jean, and exactly the opposite
of Diane in every respect. In this, lay a pain
new and sharp for Diane. She had hoped that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Mademoiselle le Roi would prove excessively
stupid. On the contrary, the young woman
turned out to be very bright.</p>

<p>No one knows the meaning of pain who has
not suffered jealousy. The iron entered into
Diane&#8217;s soul when she overheard Grandin
saying to his wife that the new girl would soon
be as good an actress as Diane, and was much
handsomer, which was the truth. And everybody
was so taken up with rehearsing Mademoiselle
Rose; Diane felt herself already thrust
out from that ideal world of the stage which
to her was the real world. True, the anticipated
joy of being married to the man she
adored lost none of its delicious charm, its soft
seductiveness, but with it was mingled much
real suffering, and a strange and awful dislocation
of life.</p>

<p>In those three weeks, Diane was so torn by
powerful emotions of all sorts, love, pain, grief,
jealousy, fear, triumph, and a thousand other
minor things, that she neither ate nor slept,
and grew even thinner than ever. And Mademoiselle
Rose was so fresh and fair! Nevertheless,
Diane&#8217;s acting did not suffer. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
contrary, like the poor princess who had burning
needles in her shoes, Diane was keyed up
to do better work than ever in her life. Never
had been her comedy so good. Off the stage,
she had no more humor than a cat; on the stage,
she could throw an audience into spasms of
merriment. Her voice, too, had in it a celestial
thrill that made her little songs move to laughter
or bring to tears as never before.</p>

<p>The Marquis was often at the music hall in
those evenings, and Diane unconsciously played
directly at him.</p>

<p>Every night, as she made up before her little
scrap of a mirror in the canvas den, she would
think to herself, as a condemned person thinks
of the day of execution:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are but ten more nights for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the next night:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are but nine left.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to the Marquis&#8217; visits, which Diane rigidly
fixed at two a week, and had her own way
about it, as she always did, they, like everything
else in the extraordinary time, were full of joy
and pain. First, was the joy of being with him,
of hearing his delightful voice, and seeing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in his beautiful uniform, and the stupendous
triumph of it all to her.</p>

<p>At these visits, Madame Grandin, frightened
half to death, was always present. Diane invariably
rose in a stately manner at the end of
half an hour&mdash;her book of etiquette prescribed
that&mdash;and the Marquis, acting just
as the book said all fiancés should, complained
bitterly of being turned out, and promised
reprisals.</p>

<p>It was a strange time to all who were drawn
within the whirlpool of emotion that dashed
them around in a circle of agitation, stunned
and amazed them, made them to be envied and
pitied, and in short, as François said, they were
exhibited as the puppets of the great God.</p>

<small>THE BRIDAL VEIL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Grandins were perfectly satisfied with
Mademoiselle Rose, to Diane&#8217;s infinite chagrin.
This reconciled them to Diane&#8217;s marriage,
which, of course, overwhelmed them with its
splendor. Grandin let his imagination loose,
and told so many lies about the Marquis&#8217;
shooting-box, which was magnified first into
a large country house, then into a chateau, and
finally into a mediæval castle, that he really
came to believe the story himself. In vain
Madame Grandin corrected him and pointed
out amiably that he was lying. But Madame
Grandin herself grew capable of believing
anything when she saw a real, live marquis
sitting in a chair discussing wedding plans with
Diane.</p>

<p>Jean Leroux plodded about in the daytime,
and at night, like Diane, would say to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are but ten more nights; there are
but nine more nights.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Alas, like her, the storm and stress of feeling
improved his acting. He conceived a hatred
of the innocent and buxom Rose le Roi, and
began to dread the idea of making stage love
to her. Being an honest fellow, however, he
kept this to himself, although in his own mind
he called the tall, handsome Rose a great
bouncing lummux, and about as impressionable
as a Normandy heifer.</p>

<p>François was the only one of them who behaved
unconcernedly, or who laughed during
those three weeks. He chaffed Diane remorselessly,
but always with good nature, and offered
to provide her with a pedigree as long as that
of the Marquis, and advised her to return to
what he declared was the original spelling of
her name, D&#8217;Orian, and boldly proclaim herself
a scion of that noble house. The family,
he declared, antedated the Cæsars, and was
founded shortly after Romulus and Remus, and
asserted that the planet Aurania was named for
Diane&#8217;s ancestors. At these jokes, all would
once have laughed; now, nobody thought them
amusing except François himself.</p>

<p>François breakfasted with the Bishop several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
times in those tumultuous days, and on every
occasion, as Mathilde sardonically remarked
to the Bishop, something mysteriously disappeared.
A handsome muffler of the Bishop&#8217;s
apparently evaporated, also an excellent umbrella,
and several other useful trifles.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the Bishop, boldly, to Mathilde,
&#8220;suppose I gave that scarf to M. le Bourgeois?
I never liked it. And as for the umbrella&mdash;well,
it stood in the anteroom and may have
disappeared in any one of a hundred ways, and
an umbrella is like innocence&mdash;once lost, it
is never recovered. Why are you so suspicious,
Mathilde? And besides, do you think I can
forget that my father was a laborer on the
estates of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So your Grace has told me a thousand times,&#8221;
rudely interrupted Mathilde, flinging out of
the room.</p>

<p>The Bishop winked softly to himself; as
usual, he had merely suggested a hypothetical
case. He knew as well as Mathilde where
the scarf and the umbrella and the rest of the
things went.</p>

<p>Even the General succumbed to François&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
charms to the extent of ten francs which François
asked as a temporary assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; as François said, &#8220;you know the
proverb&mdash;&#8216;God is omnipotent, but money is
His first lieutenant.&#8217; Virtue cannot secure
a man from poverty&mdash;else, would I be lending
money instead of borrowing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Bion promptly handed out the ten
francs, and as promptly put it down in his notebook
under the head of &#8220;Charity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop, by way of excusing himself for
listening to François&#8217; songs and jokes and watching
his delicious antics, began to urge François
quite seriously to repent and confess. At this
François balked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I should do that, your Grace,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I would commit the only one of the sins in the
calendar of which I have not had experience;
this is hypocrisy. I don&#8217;t repent of anything
I ever did except one thing. The other sins
I repented when I was caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;François,&#8221; cried the Bishop, scandalized,
&#8220;after what you have admitted to me that
you have done! And what, pray, is the only
sin that troubles your conscience?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&#8220;Once,&#8221; said François, &#8220;I saw a young lady,
an actress now in our company, who is soon to
be married, dressing in her dressing-room at
the theatre, and I looked at her in her unsunned
loveliness for about two seconds. I am very
sorry for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was indeed wicked, gross, beyond words,&#8221;
said the Bishop. &#8220;But there are other wicked
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The others,&#8221; said François, grinning, &#8220;were
merely sins against myself. I think I have been
remarkably free from injuring other persons.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop could not concede this, and
delivered a long lecture to François. In return
for it, François did some of his best stunts with
only the Bishop as audience, and then going
to the wheezy old piano played and sang some
of the old songs which always made the tears
rain upon the Bishop&#8217;s gentle face.</p>

<p>On the Thursday night was Diane&#8217;s last performance,
as it was desired that Mademoiselle
Rose should make her début before the Saturday
night, when they always had the biggest audience
of the week.</p>

<p>No prisoner dressing for the guillotine ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
felt more acutely that he was crossing the
bridge between two worlds than did Diane on
the Thursday night. That night she would
dwell for the last time in the world where lovers
were always true and the villain was always
punished in public. Beyond, in the other
world, lay Paradise, but it was unfamiliar.
That day she had seen the Marquis for the last
time until she and Madame Grandin were to
step in the carriage which the Marquis was to
send for them on the Saturday morning, and
go out to the village near the shooting-box where
the wedding was to take place in the village
church. Diane had begged the Marquis to
remain away from the music hall that night.
She said to him in Madame Grandin&#8217;s presence:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I see you, and even think you are in the
audience, I shall break down; I can never go
through my part, and I shall be forever disgraced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How ridiculous!&#8221; cried the Marquis, laughing.
&#8220;What difference can it make to you now
that you are to become the Marquise Egmont
de St. Angel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane made no reply; she could not make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
any one understand, who had not lived in the
ideal world, what it meant to disgrace one&#8217;s self
in public by breaking down. Madame Grandin
said, however:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true. But how can a marquis
understand common people like you and me,
Diane?&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything was ready; the white muslin,
nicely washed and ironed, was in Diane&#8217;s chest
of drawers. The wedding veil and wreath of
orange blossoms, which had cost all of ten
francs, lay on top of the wedding gown, carefully
wrapped in tissue paper. That wedding
veil was floating before Diane&#8217;s eyes just as a
poor mortal, leaving this world which he loves
and all the people in it, sees the silvery cloud
that masks the gates of pearl leading to Paradise.
All the time, whether on the stage or off, she
was saying to herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the last time, the last, the last, the
last.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all the others said the same:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the last time, Diane.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grandins drove a knife into Diane&#8217;s
heart by adding:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>&#8220;But we expect to do just as well with Mademoiselle
Rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Jean, the taciturn, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of it, Diane, after to-night we shall never
act together any more! To-morrow you will be
a different person, and Saturday you will have a
different name and be living in a different world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will never change, Jean, while I live,&#8221;
cried Diane, tremulously. &#8220;I will always run
to meet you when you come to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were both off the stage for two minutes
while they were speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t come to see you,&#8221; said Jean.
&#8220;Good night will be good-by for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>François&#8217; reminders were totally different.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t expect to be noticed by you after
you are a marquise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My family is
not as ancient as that of the Egmont de St.
Angel, although we are related, and my ancestors
fought with Philippe le Bel. But the Marquis&#8217;
family were ennobled before mine, and as for
you&mdash;good God! we are all parvenus when
compared with the D&#8217;Orian family, going back
to Romulus and Remus.&#8221;</p>

<p>This made Diane laugh a little, but it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
not loosen the clutch of something like the hand
of fate upon her heart, and she frankly burst
out crying when François added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody will ever dare to call you Skinny
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane, when she wiped the grease paint off
that night, washed her face with her tears.</p>

<p>Madame Grandin suggested that she leave her
make-up and little mirror for Mademoiselle Rose,
as they represented several francs, but Diane
would neither give them nor sell them to her
successor, and jealously carried every scrap of
her belongings back to her lodging.</p>

<p>All night she lay in her little white bed staring
at the winter sky through the window, and at
a mocking, grinning moon that obstinately
refused to leave the sky until day was breaking,
a pallid, wet, and dreary day. As soon as
it was light, Diane slipped out of bed and went
to the chest of drawers and took a look at the
wedding veil and wreath. It seemed to her
as if she had spent a night of agony, and that
the sight of that veil and the memory of Egmont&#8217;s
kisses were all that could solace the
strange passion of regret that possessed her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Diane contrived to busy herself the whole
morning through. It did not take her long to
pack up her small wardrobe, but she could not
persuade herself to sit down in splendid idleness
like a true marquise, but went to work in the
kitchen, cleaning out presses and boxes, anything,
in short, to keep her at work. Even
that was the last time she would have the
privilege of cleaning up a kitchen.</p>

<p>The Grandins were very much taken up with
Mademoiselle Rose at the music hall, and Jean and
François were assisting in rehearsing the newcomer.</p>

<p>At the midday dinner Mademoiselle Rose
was present, and received, so Diane thought in
the bitterness of her heart, entirely too much
attention. In the midst of the dinner a magnificent
bouquet for Diane arrived from the
Marquis with a letter sealed with a crest.
It seemed to Diane during that meal that the
storm of conflicting emotions reached its height;
she felt herself to be the most triumphant and
the most humiliated of women, the most reluctant
and the most eager of brides, wretched
beyond words, elated beyond expression, miserable,
happy, and utterly bewildered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>In the afternoon a fog came up, cold and
white, and Diane was thinking of once more
going to the park and seeking in the maze of
clipped cedars the spot where she had known
a tumult of joy. As she stood looking out of
the window of her little room, an omnibus
passed and stopped. From it descended a lady
and a little girl who came straight to the door
and pulled the bell. Steps were heard ascending
the stairs, and a knock came at Diane&#8217;s door.
When she opened it, the lady&mdash;for she was unmistakably
that, in spite of the shabbiness of
her attire&mdash;walked in unceremoniously, holding
by the hand the little girl, and, turning, locked
and bolted the door behind her. Then, throwing
back her veil, she said in a smooth and composed
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;This, I believe is Mademoiselle Diane
Dorian?&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane bowed, and her quick eye took in the
appearance of her guest. She was a woman of
thirty, and had once been pretty and even now
was interesting, but sallow and thin like a
person recovering from an illness. The little
girl, too, who was about six years old, was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
pale as a snowdrop, and sank rather than sat
upon a little stool, leaning her head against her
mother&#8217;s knee, who sat down at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray excuse me,&#8221; said the newcomer, &#8220;but
I am very tired with travelling, and I am not
strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221; asked Diane
with ready sympathy, and advancing as if to
take the child&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>The visitor held up one hand and put the other
around the child as if to ward off Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said, &#8220;let me tell you who I am.
I am the wife of the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel,
and this is his child. Here is my wedding ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew off a small and shabby glove, and
handed a plain gold ring to Diane. Inside of
it was clearly legible, &#8220;F. E. de St. A. and
E. F&#8221; with a date seven years back. Then the
wife of the Marquis de St. Angel took from her
breast a large locket containing three miniatures
painted on the same piece of ivory. One face
was her own, another was that of Egmont de
St. Angel, and the third was the baby face of
the little child. On the back were engraved
their names.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Diane handed both the ring and the locket
back to the wife of the man she loved, and
stood motionless for a moment. Then she
reeled and fell upon the bed. The silence in
the room was unbroken for five minutes except
for the coughing of the pale little child. But
Diane had not a drop of coward&#8217;s blood in her
body. At the end of five minutes she rose, and,
drawing up a chair, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all about it, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were married,&#8221; said the wife of Egmont,
&#8220;seven years ago in Algeria, where my husband
was stationed. We disagreed as a husband and
wife will disagree when the husband learns to
hate the wife and forgets his child. I was willing
to remain in Algeria in a very quiet, small
place suited to my limited means, and the climate
was good for my child, Claire. The
Marquis, you know, is head over ears in debt,
so it was easier for me in my position to be poor
in Algeria than in France. I called myself
Madame Egmont. He often proposed a divorce,
and I as often refused and offered to
return to France, although I did not wish to
come, because it suited me in every way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
remain in Algeria. Some weeks ago I heard
that he professed to have got a divorce from
me, and would marry a music-hall singer. I
came home at once. But I was ill on the way
and could not travel for a few days after landing.
I found out, no matter how, that you
were the woman he proposed to marry. I
found out, also, that his conduct in other ways
has been such that he will soon be dismissed
from the army, so that I suppose he was willing
to take desperate chances, for he is a desperate
man, you may believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe,&#8221; answered Diane. &#8220;And I
promise you that I will see him but once again,
and that is to-morrow morning when he comes
to take me away&mdash;but he will not take me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women talked in an ordinary key
and with strange calmness.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you fail to suspect the Marquis?&#8221;
said Madame Egmont. &#8220;Have you no friends
to advise you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have very good friends. But we are
very humble people&mdash;except one of us&mdash;and
we don&#8217;t understand great people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall remain here,&#8221; said Madame Egmont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
&#8220;in this town for some days, until I can see my
husband&#8217;s colonel&mdash;I want to save the name
my child bears. Besides, I am not really able
to travel&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke, and then, suddenly
turning an ashy white, fell over in a dead faint
in Diane&#8217;s arms. Diane, who was strong and
supple despite her slimness, carried Madame
Egmont like a child and laid her on the bed,
Diane&#8217;s own bed, and loosened her clothes and
did promptly what is to be done for a woman in
a faint. The frightened child began to cry,
and the sound seemed to bring back Madame
Egmont&#8217;s wandering consciousness. Diane
picked up the child and placed her on the bed,
and then ran and fetched a glass of wine for
Madame Egmont.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had a bit of bread,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>A light broke upon Diane&#8217;s mind. She ran
back into the little kitchen, started up the fire,
and put some broth on it to warm; then rummaging
in the cupboard she found some milk which
she heated, too.</p>

<p>In ten minutes she walked in the room with
a tray. Madame Egmont, sitting up in the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bed, ate her broth and bread, while Diane fed
the child sitting in her lap. Then laying the
little girl in the bed by the side of her mother,
Diane took out a fresh night-dress, and going
up to Madame Egmont proceeded unceremoniously
to undress her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Madame
Egmont, weak and bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Diane, &#8220;that neither you
nor this child are in any condition to leave this
house to-night, and that you are to sleep in
my bed, and I will make a comfortable place
on the sofa with pillows for Claire, and you
shall stay here, and I will take care of you until
you are able to leave&mdash;for you are the best
friend I ever had in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Egmont suddenly put down her
spoon, and covering her face with her
hands, burst into wild weeping, crying meanwhile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that you would not care, that
you would have my husband on any terms,
and now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The broth is getting cold, and the child
is getting frightened,&#8221; interrupted Diane with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
authority. &#8220;Now pray behave yourself, and
stop crying, and let me put the child to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Egmont did not stop crying at once,
but Diane, drawing up the sofa to the other
side of the bed, proceeded to make with pillows
and covers ruthlessly taken from Madame
Grandin&#8217;s stores, a comfortable little nest for
the child. She then proceeded to put a dressing-sack
of her own on the little Claire, by
way of a night-dress, and bundled her up in bed,
where she gave her more hot milk. Next, she
started to make a fire in the little fireplace.
The wood was sullen, however, and would not
go off at once. Diane, opening the drawer in
the bureau, took out the wedding veil and
wreath, and thrusting them into the fireplace,
a cheerful, ruddy blaze sprang up immediately.
Madame Egmont laughed softly at Diane&#8217;s
action.</p>

<p>Kindness and warmth and food worked a
miracle in Madame Egmont and the child.
Madame Egmont lay in bed, calm and resigned;
she was a feeble creature physically, not strong
and robust like Diane, and the limit of her
struggles was reached for the time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>As for the little girl, she lay quite happy and
peaceful and dozed off into a soft sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Diane, &#8220;you shall stay here
as long as you wish. I claim one more interview
with your husband at which I shall treat
him not as a fine lady like you would treat him,
but as an honest girl, a music-hall singer, would.
I promise you I shall make him sad and sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something like the ghost of a smile came to
the pale lips of Madame Egmont at this frank
admission of the social gulf between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going out now,&#8221; said Diane, &#8220;but I
will come back at seven o&#8217;clock and bring you
a good supper, and make you both comfortable
for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Egmont held out her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t kiss you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because I
know my husband has kissed you, but you may
kiss my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women looking into each other&#8217;s
eyes understood perfectly; Madame Egmont,
in giving Diane permission to press her fresh,
red lips to the cheek of the little snowdrop of a
child, was being accorded the greatest honor
that one woman may accord another.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; said Diane, &#8220;from the bottom
of my heart,&#8221; as she kneeled by the sofa and
took the child in her arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>It was five o&#8217;clock, and the fog was increasing
every moment, but something stronger than
herself drove Diane at full speed toward the
maze in the dusky park. She did not want to
face the Grandins and François and Jean, and
especially Mademoiselle Rose, until she was
obliged to do so.</p>

<p>At supper, which was at six o&#8217;clock, the party
missed Diane. As it was the first night of
Mademoiselle Rose&#8217;s appearance, they were all
rather hurried, and made no search for Diane,
expecting her to appear at every moment.
Just as they were about to rise from the table,
Diane walked in. Her face was flushed, her
eyes brilliant. She had to make a terrible
confession, but, with the undying instinct of
an actress, she meant to do it in the most
dramatic manner possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, all of you,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the Marquis
Egmont de St. Angel is a scoundrel, a criminal.
He has already a wife and child that are now
in this house. Just wait until to-morrow morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
when he comes to take me to the village that
we may be married&mdash;Ha, ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her laugh, studied and rippling like an actress&#8217;s,
made Jean&#8217;s blood run cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask me no questions, and I will tell you
no lies,&#8221; she added. No one spoke, except
Madame Grandin, who, after a gasp, said that
it was well Diane had found it out in time.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Rose looked a trifle uneasy.
She thought that Diane might want her old
place back again. Diane knew this by clairvoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed, Mademoiselle,&#8221; said
Diane, who considered the innocent Rose as
her worst enemy next the Marquis Egmont de
St. Angel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get an engagement in Paris without
the slightest difficulty. When you come back
from the theatre, Grandin, please to go to your
room the other way, because I shall have to
sleep on the sofa here to-night. The wife and
child of the Marquis are in my room. To-morrow
I shall be gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all were stunned and dazed, but governed
by the iron discipline of the stage which required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
them in five minutes to be in their canvas
dressing-rooms, rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always told you I was ashamed to own the
Marquis as a cousin,&#8221; said François after a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the advertisement is not utterly lost,&#8221;
bellowed Grandin. &#8220;I only hope Mademoiselle
Rose will have an adventure with a marquis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Madame Grandin, reproachfully,
to her husband, &#8220;you always think of advertising
first! Well, Diane expected something
great to happen at Bienville, and I am sure
something great <i>has</i> happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only Jean lingered a moment as he passed
Diane, his strong face working in agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will kill him, Diane!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; cried Diane, catching him by the
sleeve, &#8220;that would be doing him a service.
And besides, it would cost your life. No, leave
him to me; I will do much worse than kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean went out, and Diane, taking off her hat
and cloak, busied herself with arranging a little
supper on a tray for Madame Egmont and the
child. She took it in, stirred up the fire once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
more, and lighted a softly shaded lamp.
Madame Egmont made no fresh protests of
gratitude, but her eyes were eloquent, and the
little girl clung to Diane. Warmth and food
and attendance were luxuries to the wife and
child of the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel.</p>

<p>The next morning at ten o&#8217;clock a handsome
livery carriage drove up to the door, and the
Marquis in ordinary morning dress got out and
came upstairs. He knocked gayly at the door
of the little sitting-room, and Diane&#8217;s clear voice
called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis entered, and, instead of seeing
Diane in bridal array, found her wearing her
ordinary black morning gown, and sitting by
the table with a basket of stockings before
her which she was darning industriously. He
started in surprise, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this, Diane? I
have come for you and Madame Grandin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to be married to-day,&#8221;
responded Diane, coolly, holding up a stocking
to the light and clipping a thread; &#8220;I have
changed my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>The Marquis stood in stunned surprise for
a few moments, then gradually an angry
flush overspread his handsome face, and he
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? This is the most
extraordinary conduct I have ever known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not half as extraordinary as yours,&#8221; answered
Diane, still darning away diligently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand an explanation,&#8221; replied the Marquis,
violently. &#8220;I do not choose to be treated
in this manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane finished a pair of stockings, smoothed
them out, rolled them up carefully, laid her
sewing implements in the basket, and taking
from her pocket the locket of the Marquis and
his wife and child, showed it to him.</p>

<p>The face of Egmont de St. Angel changed to
a deadly pallor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That woman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;was my wife, but
she disappeared in Algeria, and I have not seen
her or heard of her for seven years, so that I have
a legal right to presume that she is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a terrible lie you are telling!&#8221;
answered Diane. &#8220;You have heard from her
in the last year, but you thought she was out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the way in Algeria. And I don&#8217;t think now
that you ever really meant to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was the chance of the Marquis. He
smiled and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I was doing you a great honor in taking
up with you on any terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had remained standing, and Diane rose,
too, and went toward the bedroom door of
Madame Grandin. She opened it suddenly,
and Madame Grandin, who had been on her
knees listening at the keyhole, tumbled into the
room, but speedily got up on her feet. Behind
her were Grandin, François, and Jean.</p>

<p>Then Diane turned, and, walking back to the
Marquis, lifted up her strong, young hand and
gave him a terrible blow on the cheek.</p>

<p>The Marquis, stunned with surprise, staggered
back, then, recovering himself, advanced with his
fist uplifted. The gaze of the man and woman
met, hate and fury in the eyes of the Marquis,
fury and hate in those of Diane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Grandins, François, and Jean
had all burst into a concerted stage laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, my dear Marquis of the Holy
Angels!&#8221; cried François; &#8220;you haven&#8217;t done the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
handsome thing, I must say, and this young
lady has served you right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean said nothing at all, but making a lunge
toward the Marquis, collared him and threw
him on the floor. Then with his knee on the
Marquis&#8217;s chest, Jean thumped and pounded
his enemy.</p>

<p>Diane stood by, laughing and clapping her
hands. The Marquis was a strong and lithe
young man, but Jean, a maniac in his rage, was
a match for two of him. In the end he had to be
dragged off the Marquis, who tottered to his
feet, wiped the blood off his face, and made some
vague threats. But he was evidently in the
house of his enemies.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall pay for this, every one of you!&#8221;
he shouted; &#8220;I will call you all as witnesses to
this assault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do!&#8221; cried François; &#8220;I will go before the
police and swear that you struck this young lady
and were threatening to kill her, and were only
prevented by Jean Leroux holding you, and that
you have made threats against the lives of all of
us. Of course, the whole affair will come before
your colonel, and then we shall see what we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
see. And by the way, don&#8217;t ask me to supper
with you any more, for I wouldn&#8217;t be seen with
a low dog like you. And in particular, I disown
you as a relative.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but for the Marquis
to leave. He got downstairs as best he could,
limping, with no look whatever of a bridegroom,
slipped into the carriage, and was driven away.</p>

<p>Jean then went to wash off the stains of his
encounter, and Diane disappeared.</p>

<p>François ran off to tell the story to the good
Bishop, who dearly loved gossip.</p>

<p>When they met for dinner at noon, Diane
was not present, but on the table lay a letter
addressed to Madame Grandin. It read:</p>



<p>&#8220;Dear Madame Grandin: I thank you and
Monsieur Grandin for all your kindness to me,
and I thank François for teaching me to act,
and Jean for teaching me to sing and being
always good to me. I don&#8217;t know how I can
live without all of you, but I cannot face you
after what has happened. I shall be far away
when you read this. Take care of the lady and
the little girl in my room until they are able
to go away. You will find one hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fifty-two francs in the cupboard in the kitchen,
and I want you to use that for them and buy
a plenty of milk for the little child. Don&#8217;t
tell them where it comes from; I think they
are very badly off for money. Oh, Madame
Grandin! truly, there is a thorn in every heart,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the sheet was blotted apparently with
tears, but at the bottom was scribbled the
signature, &#8220;Diane Dorian.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE DELUGE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> brilliant afternoon in July, five years
later, all Paris went crazy. Vast multitudes
surged through the streets cheering, laughing,
shouting, singing, for were not the days of glory
to be repeated? War was declared on Prussia,
and, after more than fifty years, the eagles of
France were to take their majestic course
across the Rhine; again the soldiers of France
were to bivouac in every capital in Europe, for
once started upon the path of conquest, France
has ever been impossible to stop, so thought
everybody in Paris that July day.</p>

<p>The streets were like great rivers of humanity,
with wild whirlpools and clamoring cataracts,
all drifting toward the ocean, and that ocean
was the Palace of the Tuilleries. Bands rent
the air with the Marseillaise, the great battle
hymn of liberty. Often wrested to unworthy
purposes, often sung and played by those who
hate liberty and love anarchy, the mighty hymn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ever remained the battle-cry of those who would
be free. Troops were marching along, splendid
hussars and chasseurs trotting gayly through
the sunlit streets, steady, red-legged infantry
swinging along to their barracks, Zouaves in
baggy trousers and hanging caps sauntered and
swaggered. Officers clattered along joyously
as they made a brilliant streak of color in the
great river of men and women. Everywhere a
uniform was seen a ringing cheer went up from
men and women, young and old, palpitating
with pride and joy in these men called to repeat
the glories of their ancestors. As the Emperor
had said, whatever road they took across the
frontier they would find glorious traces of their
fathers. Wherever the French had crossed
in days past, they had left a trail of glory behind
them.</p>

<p>Many groups of soldiers loitered along the
streets, or stopped to laugh and joke on the
street comers. Men clapped them on the back,
and handsome young women smiled and waved
their hands at them, and gray-haired grandmothers
blessed them. Great ladies in their
carriages stopped and laughed and talked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
private soldiers; even the beggars forgot to
beg, and hobnobbed with everybody. A beggar
was as good as the best, provided only he
were French.</p>

<p>All was sunshine, a splendor of hope, magnificence,
joy. Once more France would &#8220;gird
her beauteous limbs with steel,&#8221; and smite with
her mailed hand those who would oppress
her.</p>

<p>What were her resources? Every man who
could carry a musket. What was her matériel?
All the iron, all the steel, all the lead, all the
gunpowder in France. What were her soldiers?
Heroes, backed up by all her old men,
her children, her maidens, and her matrons.</p>

<p>The crowd was most dense in the splendid
open space before the Tuilleries gardens, and
extended for a long distance on either side
of the palace. The air was drenched with perfume
from the gardens; the river ran red like
wine, in the old Homeric phrase; the windows
of the palace blazed in the afternoon light. On
a balcony occasionally appeared the Emperor,
who bore the magic name of Napoleon, the
Empress, a dream of smiling beauty, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Prince Imperial, a mere lad, but who was to
go out on the firing line along with the veterans.</p>

<p>All the gorgeous carriages and all the graceful
horsemen and horsewomen that were usually
found at that hour on the Bois de Boulogne
formed a great procession moving at a snail&#8217;s pace,
and often stopped by the congestion in the broad
Rue de Rivoli and all the fine streets adjacent.</p>

<p>From many points could be seen the Place
Vendôme with the great column made from
captured Prussian guns surmounted by the
statue of the immortal man who made Europe
tremble at his nod.</p>

<p>The police were good-natured, the crowd was
amiable; there was tremendous excitement,
but no disorder. At the slightest incident,
multitudes burst into cheering. The ladies
sitting back in their victorias clapped their
delicate, gloved hands and waved their filmy
handkerchiefs, laughing at the soldiers who
paid them bold compliments ten inches away
from their faces. The cavaliers and ladies on
horseback exchanged patriotic chaff with those
who surged about them.</p>

<p>Among the crowd directly in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Tuilleries was Jean Leroux, not the Jean Leroux
of that winter in Bienville five years
before, but another Jean, well dressed, well
mannered, successful, but modest withal.</p>

<p>As the carriages moved slowly past, going
a few feet and then stopping, blockaded by the
crowd, a pretty victoria, well horsed, came
directly abreast of Jean Leroux. In it sat
Diane, whom he had often seen on the stage
in those five years, but to whom he had never
had the courage to speak; for if Jean was successful,
Diane was a hundred times more so.
She was on that day the most popular music-hall
artist in Paris. Like Jean, she was Diane
and yet not Diane. Her beautiful, mysterious
dark eyes were unchanged, her frank, sweet
smile was the same, but she was Mademoiselle
Dorian, not merely Diane, or worse still, Skinny;
that expressed it all. She had eaten the fruit
of the Tree of Knowledge; she knew the great,
ugly, beautiful, laughing, weeping, snarling,
generous, wicked, pious world; she was able
to take care of herself; she could stand upon her
feet and look the ferocious human race in the
eye as Una faced the lion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>She wore a charming white gown and a lovely
flower-crowned hat, and carried a tiny white
lace parasol as if she were accustomed to lace
parasols. Her white kid gloves were dainty,
and a great bunch of white and crimson roses
combined with the blue cornflower made a tricolor
in her lap, while on her breast was pinned
a tricolor rosette.</p>

<p>As her carriage stopped, the crowd recognized
her, and a huge shout went up:</p>

<p>&#8220;La Dorian! La Dorian!&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane was used to this cry. She bowed and
smiled prettily, like the experienced actress
she was, but that was not what the crowd
wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing us La Marseillaise!&#8221; they shouted;
&#8220;you can sing it as no one else can! Sing it,
sing it to us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane stood up in the carriage holding her
tricolor bouquet, and a great roar of cheering
a thousand times greater than she had ever
heard before, stormed the air. Diane stood
erect, with her head thrown back.</p>

<p>At last there was silence, and Diane, pointing
with her white gloved hand straight at Jean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not ten feet away, cried in her clear, practised,
penetrating voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a man who can sing La Marseillaise
better than I can. Bring him here, and
make him sing it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd, cheering and laughing, immediately
seized Jean, and, in spite of his modest
protests, hurled him into the carriage, where he
sat down protesting and embarrassed. While
the multitude was quieting down, Diane and he
exchanged a few words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you been to see me in all these
years?&#8221; said Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you were too grand,&#8221; said Jean.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to thrust myself upon a great
artist. You might have thought that I wanted
you to do something for me, or to get me an
engagement. But I have often gone to the
music-halls to hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were always a goose about some things,
Jean Leroux!&#8221; was Diane&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>And then the silence was complete, and the
multitudes that packed the streets a mile on
either hand waited to hear the first word of the
hymn of battle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>As Diane stood up in the carriage, her slim
figure grew taller, and her blood turned to fire
in her veins; her voice cleft the air like a silver
trumpet, sweet and penetrating, and vibrant
with patriotic passion. When she proclaimed,</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;The day of glory has arrived!&#8221;</p>

<p>the effect was like Jeanne d&#8217;Arc striking her
spear upon her shield. Then came the great
refrain,</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Aux armes! Aux armes!&#8221;</p>

<p>One voice arose&mdash;the voices of tens of thousands,
united in one vast ringing call to victory,
one great demand for the rights of man,
one last appeal to the God of Battles. The
mighty echo rose from earth to heaven; it
seemed for a time to fill the universe, and then
to leave the universe listening for it.</p>

<p>The chorus ceased&mdash;a chorus greater than
ever mortal ear had heard since first the men of
Marseilles marched to the thunder of their
battle hymn&mdash;and Jean Leroux stood up and
sang the second verse. His was the voice of a
man ready to march and to fight. The artist&#8217;s
soul within Diane quivered as she heard Jean&#8217;s
splendid basso like the tones of the organ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Notre Dame pealing out. Again the refrain was
thundered from the multitudes that filled miles
of streets, and the sound seemed to shake the
towers of the Tuilleries palace. Then it was
Diane&#8217;s turn to sing the third verse. The nation
that produced Jeanne d&#8217;Arc respects the patriotism
of its women; they are as ready to die for
their country as are the men. At the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Great God! By these our fettered hands,</div>
<div class="verse">Our brows beneath the open yoke,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Diane lifted her eyes to Heaven, and raised her
clasped hands above her head. It was like
Charlotte Corday demanding God&#8217;s blessing,
while she armed to do Him service by killing the
enemy of His children. Again did the voice of
the people make the splendid refrain sound like
a great Amen. Men were weeping and clasping
each other in their arms. Women with upraised
hands prayed for France. The meanest and
lowest among them were made respectable by
love of country. Never again were any of those
who heard the song of the nation sung on that
July afternoon, to hear it so sung. They knew
it not, but it was for them the last triumphant
singing of the hymn of triumph.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>Diane and Jean sang the hymn through to the
end. Then Jean, looking at Diane, saw that she
was as pale as death, and she was trembling
like an aspen leaf, while floods of tears ran down
her cheeks. He spoke to a policeman at the
carriage wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get us out of here as quickly as you can.
This has been too much for Mademoiselle
Dorian.&#8221;</p>

<p>A couple of brawny policemen, recovering
their senses a little, got the horses out of the
line, forced back the crowd, and the carriage
rattled down one of the small streets leading
toward the Champs-Elysées.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home,&#8221; said Jean to the coachman.</p>

<p>He thought the sooner Diane was in some quiet
spot the better. He had no idea where she
lived.</p>

<p>The horses trotted briskly along, the coachman
avoiding the great, thronged thoroughfares.
As they drove along, Diane&#8217;s composure gradually
returned. The color came back to her lips
and cheeks, and her tremors stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was enough to shake anybody,&#8221; said Jean;
&#8220;I, myself, felt as weak as a cat when I sat down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
We have never in our lives heard anything like
that. It has not been heard since before Waterloo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane said little except some murmured reproaches
to Jean for not coming to see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of you forgot me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I suppose
it was because that tall, red-cheeked, awkward
creature who took my place, absorbed you so
there was no place even in your memories for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean smiled. This was the same Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your going seemed to finish
up everything. Mademoiselle Rose was not a
success. The public did not like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane gave a little gasp of vindictive joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was bad, of course, for the Grandins,&#8221;
continued Jean, &#8220;particularly as they lost François
the same night they lost you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows. After the performance, when
François acted miserably, and was hissed and
hit on the head by a cabbage thrown at him&mdash;and
he deserved it for his bad acting, and nearly
breaking Madame Grandin&#8217;s neck in his acrobatic
turn&mdash;he disappeared. Grandin owed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
him some money, too. All we could ever find
out was, that François was seen during the night
on board the old boat, tied up on the riverside.
The police saw a man with a lantern moving
about the boat. They went on board, and found
it was François, and they drove him off. Oddly
enough, not two hours later, there was a fire on
the dock, and the wind blew the sparks to the
boat, and it was burned to the water&#8217;s edge.
You may imagine, with you and François gone,
and Mademoiselle Rose a flat failure, and the
boat burned up, it was pretty serious for Grandin.
They had a little money, you know, and
so they gave up the show business and went to a
little town in the French Alps and took to raising
chickens. It was as if, with your going, the old
life and everything melted away like a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, what did you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I got an engagement in the Bienville
theatre that took me through the season. I got
on very well, and in two years I came to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how about that scamp, the Marquis
Egmont de St. Angel?&#8221; asked Diane in a perfectly
natural voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t like to mention him,&#8221; answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Jean; &#8220;I thought you might&mdash;perhaps&mdash;well,
I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t mind,&#8221; promptly responded
Diane; &#8220;I was a great fool, of course, but no
more so than any other inexperienced girl in my
position. I thought I loved him. I know now
that he was nothing more than a peg to hang my
emotions on. It sounded so grand to be a marquise!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed so naturally and unaffectedly,
that a great load was lifted from Jean&#8217;s heart.
The Marquis was rightly appraised by Diane,
and she had no regrets for such a scoundrel.
Then she kept on, still laughing:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have been perfectly ridiculous as a
marquise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was kicked out of the army,&#8221; said Jean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Served him right,&#8221; replied Diane, vigorously.
&#8220;One thing rejoices me&mdash;that awful whack I
let him have in the face, and I shall always love
you, Jean, for the beating you gave him. He
deserved it all for his treatment of his wife and
child. What became of the poor lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She went to the Marquis&#8217; colonel and told
him the whole story. The Marquis made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
stiff fight because he had powerful family connections,
but they got rid of him. It was really
true, though, that he meant to marry you and
commit bigamy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jean,&#8221; cried Diane with the deepest
feeling, &#8220;how often have I though of poor François&#8217;
saying, that God takes care of women and
fools and drunken people! If I had married
the Marquis, I should have killed him, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me,&#8221; said Jean, &#8220;how did you get
up in the world so quickly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am a woman and a fool,&#8221; answered
Diane with great simplicity. &#8220;I had a hundred
and fifty-two francs&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After you had given half you had to the other
woman,&#8221; interjected Jean.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I travelled third class to Paris. On the
train I bought a newspaper and looked out for
all the advertisements of singing teachers whose
terms were reasonable. I found one in a musician
and his wife. They took me to live in their
house for what board I could pay. The singing
master said at once that I had a better voice
than I supposed, and he got me into the chorus
at the Opera. That paid me something, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
worked, I can tell you, at my singing. The
first engagement I had was at a cheap place on
the other side of the river, but I went on steadily,
earning more money and more people knowing
me. I didn&#8217;t visit Bohemia, nor go out to supper,
nor do any of those crazy things that ruin
the voice. I think my singing teacher valued
my voice above my soul, but at all events, the
time came when I was able to pay him well for
his trouble, and began to lay up something
comfortable for myself. And here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And buy diamonds,&#8221; suggested Jean. &#8220;I
saw you blazing with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They were pure
paste. I am not half such a fool in some ways as
you think. But why, why didn&#8217;t you come to
see me? How could you look at me when I
was singing and not think enough of the old
days to seek me out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you were too grand,&#8221; replied
Jean. &#8220;I took the paste things for real diamonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently they reached in a quiet street a
small, pretty house with a charming little garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Jean was surprised; he expected to find something
much grander, and plainly said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;No indeed,&#8221; answered Diane, dismissing
the coachman and showing Jean the way through
the drawing-room by glass doors down the steps
into the pretty garden. &#8220;I think I am of a
saving turn. I know what very few singers do,
and that is, one day my voice will be gone, so I
am saving my money now, that I may be able to
live here always, and have you to tea with me
in the summer afternoons. I always knew I
would see you, Jean, and tell you this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean scowled fiercely at Diane. She was
making fun of him and his honest and modest
love, but he did not think she ought to say such
things to any man. So he declined to notice
Diane&#8217;s speech. When they took their seats on
the iron chairs in the garden before the little
tea-table, Diane continued her confidences:</p>

<p>&#8220;When the foolish men would send me diamonds,
I would coolly exchange them for paste
and pocket the difference. No indeed, I have
heard of music-hall artists with a great many
diamonds who were sold out by their creditors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean looked at Diane with admiration.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you had so much sense,
Diane,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then the maid brought the tea, and they sat
in the sunny garden until the purple dusk came
and a new moon smiled at them from a sky half
ruby and half sapphire.</p>

<p>They talked much of the coming war. Jean,
who was a capital shot, was to join the franc-tierurs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not keep on singing, you know, when
I could be potting the Prussians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for me,&#8221; replied Diane, &#8220;I shall keep on
singing as a patriotic duty. These Parisians
look upon their theatres and operas and music-halls
as a barometer. As long as these are open
and we sing and dance and play for this great
tyrant, Paris, so long will she believe that all is
going well, but let us once stop, and she will become
panic-stricken. However, I expect to
sing before our Emperor in Berlin next season.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed quite natural and reasonable to
Jean, and Diane, laughing, but wholly in earnest,
promised him an engagement to sing with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;For you know, Jean, you would have been
just as high up as I am, except that I had more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
impudence. Now that you have had your tea,
come into the drawing-room and let us sing
together some of the old songs and do some of
the old tricks. I have a companion who can
thump the piano a little for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane ran into the drawing-room, called for
her companion, a decorous and withered person,
Madame Dupin, who sat down to the piano and
managed the accompaniment while Diane and
Jean sang some of the old songs together with
immense spirit. Then Diane proposed to do
their singing act together, which meant a love
scene and a quarrel that had always brought
down the house in the cheap music-hall in Bienville.
Jean remembered it well enough&mdash;only
too well. The memory of the pangs he suffered
when Diane, after she met the Marquis, would
hold away from him and would not throw herself
into his arms as a real actress should, was
vivid and painful. But in the pretty drawing-room
with Madame Dupin playing away at the
piano, Diane hurled herself into Jean&#8217;s arms and
acted as if inspired. When the quarrel came,
it was acted so naturally that Diane&#8217;s man-servant,
who was peeping through the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
suddenly rushed in and, seizing Jean by the
collar, shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will report you to the police for abusing
and insulting my lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>This amused Diane so much that she threw
herself on the sofa convulsed with laughter, and
Jean laughed as he had not done since he last
saw Diane, while the man-servant, when the circumstances
were explained, ran away sheepishly,
to be the laughing-stock of his fellow-servants.</p>

<p>It was all so merry and free, and like a last
look at a happy past, when before one lies victory,
but with it, war and guns and wounds and
death.</p>

<p>Jean gave himself barely time to hurry back
in a cab to his music-hall, while Diane rushed
upstairs to make ready for her own performance.</p>

<p>Great as had been Diane&#8217;s fame before, it
grew greater in those days when France marched
forth to conquer Europe again, and was smitten
on every hand.</p>

<p>In August and September, when disaster followed
disaster, and the universe seemed tumbling
to pieces, Diane still sang La Marseillaise
every night at the music-hall. It seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
comfort and put new courage into the hearts of
her listeners, mostly striplings and weaklings and
old men who could not go to fight the Prussians,
and could only hate them from afar. The music-hall
did a rushing business; many persons
skimped their daily bread to save a couple of
francs that would take them into the music-hall
where Diane with her glorious singing would
reanimate their fainting souls. Not even when
the siege began did Diane cease her singing.
The prices were then put down, and the hall was
not so full, but all came who could.</p>

<p>Jean was gone. He was in the armies that
were defeated, or that melted away, or that
never existed except on paper. But he was
never captured. Two or three times in those
frightful months, Diane got a brief line from
him. Once he wrote:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you think I have seen? François!
And François decorated on the field, too!
But the next day, he was found dead drunk&mdash;he
had sold his boots for liquor&mdash;so he disappeared.
We had some talk, however. He asked
about you, and said he always knew Skinny
would come into her own. I inquired what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
had been doing for a living in the last five years,
and he said he had been picking flowers off
century plants for his living. You see, he is
the same François, but as brave as if he were
honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>One morning in January, every door and window
in Paris was closed and barred. The Prussians
were marching in through the Arc de
Triomphe, and the gayest city in the world lay
as if dead in her grave-clothes on that winter
morning. Not a wheel turned in Paris that day;
even the dead remained unburied. No theatre
or music-hall opened that evening, nor was there
a note of music heard in the whole city. Paris
was indeed the city of Dreadful Night. Then,
after a little breathing spell like that given a man
when shackles are put on his feet and handcuffs
on his wrists, Paris, the conquered city, sat in
her sackcloth bewailing herself for her lost glory.
And presently, in her wretchedness and despair,
some of her children were turned to devils and
fought and mocked her and lacerated her and
dragged her shrieking and blood-covered in the
mire of disgrace. The frightful orgie of the
Commune was an episode in hell for the great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
beautiful, miserable, burning, starving, shrieking
city.</p>

<p>Through it all Diane sang, not with the rich,
full voice of a well-fed, well-sleeping woman, but
with diminished volume and a little off the key;
for in those days it was remarked that all voices
were raised a semitone higher.</p>

<p>How the months passed when the Commune,
that concentration of wickedness, that collection
of fiends who sought to murder their country in
her hour of misery, few who lived through it
could describe; certainly Diane could not.
Food and money were scarce enough, though
there was not actual starvation as during the
siege, but the guns from Montmartre thundered
incessantly, and those who were to rescue Paris
had to surround her and fight their way inch by
inch.</p>

<p>It was in the springtime, and the horse chestnuts
in the Champs-Elysées were pushing out their
green leaves through their pale pink sheaths,
and the insensate sky was blue and gold by day
and black and silver by night. From the beginning
it was bad enough, but as the sun grew
warmer and the days more halcyon in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
beauty, the hell made by men grew worse, the
roaring of the guns more constant. The frightful
disorders in the streets, murders and horrible
orgies, were more frequent. The Commune
died hard, as wild boars do. The great city had
no defenders within her lines, and lay at the
mercy of fiends. The few men who had crept
back from the battle-fields could do nothing, and
when the Communards in their dirty National
Guard uniforms began to be pressed hard and
caught in their traps like rats, they began to
throw barricades across the streets and fight
behind them, wildly and foolishly.</p>

<p>Diane still lived in her small house, although
the neighborhood was daily growing more dangerous;
the tide of fighting was pouring that
way, and the quiet street resounded with the
rattle of ammunition wagons and the yells and
shouts of drunken National Guards, who were
yet not too drunk to fight. The small house
remained closed, and the two women within it&mdash;Diane
and old Marie, a faithful creature whom
Diane had picked up some years before&mdash;lived
in two cellar rooms. There, they were reasonably
safe. They dwelt in darkness, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
they had few candles, and would have been
afraid to show lights if they could. When the
one dim candle was lighted, all windows, doors,
cracks, and crannies were tightly closed to give
the idea of an uninhabited house. The upstairs
had long been dismantled, and there was little
there to steal.</p>

<p>In those terrible spring days, neither Diane
nor the old woman ever so much as showed
themselves in the garden, and only stole forth
by night to buy such meagre supplies as they
could afford. For Diane was no longer well off.
She had given freely of her store to her country,
and unless she could once more sing to crowded
audiences, she would die as poor as when she first
set foot in Paris with her hundred and fifty-two
francs in her pocket.</p>

<p>One afternoon in the last of May when the
fighting had grown fiercer, the incessant booming
of the guns nearer, and the sharp crack of the
mitrailleuse louder and more frequent, a great
crash resounded in the street before Diane&#8217;s
house. The mob of National Guards had upset
a cart-load of stones, and were beginning to tear
up the pavement to make one of those simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
but effective barricades that were sometimes
better than a good many fortifications. It only
took a couple of hours to build this fort in the
street, and it was one of the best barricades so
built in Paris, because it was directed by a man
trained as a soldier, who had once been called
the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel. Diane&#8217;s
first view of him after she had slapped his face
was as he stood or walked about the narrow
street, now crowded and noisy with disorderly
National Guards.</p>

<p>The Marquis had changed considerably for
the worse in his appearance. Six years before
he had been of superb figure and handsome face,
and dressed with military elegance. Now, he
was red and bloated and slouchy and dirty.
His voice had once been sweet and persuasive.
Now, it was a bellow of rage and drink, but
enough sense was left amid his degradation yet
to do some harm to his fellow-men, and the
barricade would have been a credit to an engineer.</p>

<p>Many persons had warned Diane to leave her
house and seek refuge somewhere else, but this
she refused. Now it was too late. For any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
woman to show herself was to court death and
horrors unspeakable.</p>

<p>Against a house on the opposite side of the
street was piled wood enough to start a fire
when the Communards were ready, for, if they
could no longer defend a point, they set fire
to the surrounding buildings. Meanwhile, the
real French soldiers rigidly carried out their plan
to surround and overwhelm the Communards
without destroying the city, and ever the cordon
tightened. On this May morning it drew
closer around the barricaded spot, and there was
fighting in the near-by street. But seeing the
danger of fire, the French commander in that
quarter played a waiting game.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the day grew dark, and in
the evening came a small, fine rain with the
darkness. An adventurous young officer tried
to carry the barricade under the cover of night,
but Colonel Egmont, as the Marquis now called
himself, had enough of the devil&#8217;s wit left in him
to drive off the attacking party.</p>

<p>Diane, peering through the chinks of a closed
jalousie, saw in the darkness the red-legged
soldiers retiring, carrying off with them a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of dead men and some wounded ones. In the
dense shadows, however, two French soldiers
remained who were not missed. One was a
small man lying flat on his face with a bullet
wound through his leg and another in his
shoulder. The other was a big man with blood
dripping from the back of his neck, who
scrambled to his feet and knelt over the little
man whose head rested against the tall iron
door that led into Diane&#8217;s garden. In a minute
or two the door was softly opened and Diane
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in quickly before you are seen. There
is a cellar to the house where you can be safe
for a little while, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man picked the small man up in his
arms and slipped within the garden, Diane
softly locking and barring the iron door behind
him, and, running around to the back of the
house, lifted the lid of a cellar door, showing
some narrow stone steps that led down into the
black cave of the cellars. As she did this, she
recognized Jean in the big man, and François
in the small man he was carrying, and Jean
recognized her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>François&#8217; soul was not in this world at that
moment, although it was shortly to return to
his body.</p>

<p>Jean and Diane wasted no time in polite inquiries
after each other&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you carry his legs?&#8221; asked Jean in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Diane, slipping down the
stairs and taking hold of François&#8217; legs, for she
could step backward, knowing the stairs well.</p>

<p>The next minute they found themselves in
the cellars. There were two small rooms. The
windows were tightly closed so that no gleam of
light should betray that the place was inhabited.
A handful of charcoal burned in a little brazier,
for the spring night was sharp and the cellar
was cold, and one solitary candle in the outer
room merely revealed the gulf of darkness.
Huddled over the brazier was the figure of old
Marie, the cook; in all cataclysms of one&#8217;s life,
some one is found who is faithful.</p>

<p>There was something like comfort in the place.
A carpet was spread upon the stone floor, and
a couple of pallets in the inner room accommodated
the mistress and the maid. On one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
these they laid François, breathing heavily.
Jean stripped off François&#8217; shoes, and Diane,
producing a pair of scissors, cut away the clothing
from his leg below the knee. A horrid
wound was spurting blood. Marie ran and
fetched some water from a barrel in the corner,
and Diane unceremoniously, in the presence of
Jean, divested herself of her white cambric
petticoat, a thing of filmy ruffles and lace, and
tore it into strips to bind up François&#8217; wounds.
Again, with her deft scissors she cut away a part
of his coat and shirt. Old Marie washed the
wound in his shoulder, and Jean, with his rude
surgery, bound it up with a part of Diane&#8217;s
petticoat. When this was over, François opened
his eyes, and looking about him whispered in a
weak voice, and with a weak grin:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I must be out of my head still,
because I see the face of Diane. Give me something
to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Marie gave him water which he drank
as men do out of whose veins much blood has
run, and who are parched with that terrible
thirst. Diane, going to a wine rack where
there were many long-necked bottles lying head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
downward, picked up one and gouged out the
cork with her scissors.</p>

<p>Then she poured out in a tin cup some bubbling
champagne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this good for him, do you think?&#8221; she
asked Jean.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the name of God, I do not know,&#8221; replied
Jean, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I know,&#8221; responded the patient in a
somewhat stronger voice. &#8220;Good champagne
will put life into the ribs of death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane kneeled down by François and tremblingly
gave him the champagne, which he drank,
smacking his lips meanwhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like another man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that
other man wants another swig at the champagne.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Diane shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have any more,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said François in a much stronger
voice, &#8220;I know that I am not wool-gathering,
but it is really you, Diane Dorian, otherwise
Skinny, because you are so obstinate, just as in
the old days.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Diane was speaking, she noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Jean had sunk on a low bench from which he
slipped softly to the floor, his eyes closed and
his face gray. Diane ran to him, and catching
his head to keep it from striking the floor,
found blood upon her hand. Jean&#8217;s neck was
bleeding&mdash;François was not the only wounded
man.</p>

<p>Diane, with her lately gained experience and
assisted by old Marie, turned back Jean&#8217;s collar
and shirt and found there a wound almost
as bad as François&#8217;. That, too, was washed and
bound with strips of Diane&#8217;s white petticoat,
and then Jean came to himself, and asked, as
all wounded men do, for water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him some champagne,&#8221; said François,
feebly, from his pallet.</p>

<p>This Diane did, and then, with Marie&#8217;s help,
laid Jean upon her own pallet.</p>

<p>Then began for the two women a silent vigil
that lasted more than a week. They took turns
in watching and sleeping. By extreme good
fortune both of their patients progressed wonderfully,
the wounds healing with the first
intention. At the end of the week Jean was
able to walk about the inner room, while François,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
though unable to walk, could sit up in
the one chair which the cellars possessed.</p>

<p>Still were darkness and silence maintained
within the cellars, although there was noise
enough outside. The barricade had become
almost a fortress, and as the Communards were
hemmed in closer and closer, the barricade
was extended. The sound of fighting grew
nearer and fiercer, the shouts and cries of men,
the rattle of ammunition wagons over the stones,
the cracking of the mitrailleuse, the crash of
bullets; the beating of the rappel, sounded by
night as well as by day.</p>

<p>After night had fallen, old Marie would
creep out, and by devious and winding streets
would find her way to places where for much
money a little coarse food could be bought.
There was, however, champagne in plenty,
and François had no hesitation in declaring
in a whisper that his recovery and that of Jean
depended upon the quantity of champagne they
drank, and that Diane was delaying their convalescence
by not letting them have all they
wished.</p>

<p>The hours, instead of being long, were extraordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
short because there was no sunrise
or sunset, no day nor night, only a vivid darkness
pierced with the light of a single candle.
There was nothing to read by the light of the
single candle that burned night and day; there
was no conversation above a whisper. Familiarity
with danger and long immunity made
them all forget their fears, but not their prudence.</p>

<p>Old Marie, who had the tireless industry
of her class, managed to keep employed by
incessant knitting, after she had done the work
of the two cellars. Diane, a worker by nature
and habit, put strong compulsion on herself to
sit still for hours and hours, her hands in her lap.
Jean and François, conquered by their weakness,
also remained still and quiet. Through the
open door Diane could not see their eyes constantly
fixed upon her in the little circle of light
made by the one candle. She took them their
food, and helped them with all the natural
helpfulness of a tender and capable woman.
That was her sole employment. She often
wished in that strange procession of time which
could not be called days or weeks, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
had fifty wounded men to attend to instead of
two.</p>

<p>At last, one night, Jean said to Diane:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for me to be going. I feel strong
enough to carry a musket, and I shall feel
stronger still when I get into the fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane said no word; she was the last woman
on earth to detain a man from his duty.</p>

<p>François, who was then able to walk about
with a stick made from a broom handle, protested
in a whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is to chaperon Diane and me,&#8221; he
asked, &#8220;when old Marie goes out at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Jean slipped cautiously to the
stone steps and lifted up the cellar door about
an inch, showing the black night without. A
great wave of smoke and an odor of flame
rushed in, and through the crack thus made
was seen a sky on fire with the luridness of miles
of burning buildings. Paris had been set on
fire by the Communards.</p>

<p>As Diane, leaning over Jean&#8217;s shoulder,
caught a glimpse of the blazing sky, there was
a crash of doors and windows overhead, a
trampling of feet, drunken men and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
shouting, laughing, swearing, fighting. In the
midst of the uproar they could hear the grand
piano, the only piece of furniture left in the
house, dragged across the drawing-room floor,
and the crash of music as it was pounded to
accompany ribald songs. Jean quickly dropped
the cellar door. They had no arms except each
a pistol out of which their bullets had been
fired, and there were no more bullets to be had.</p>

<p>As the drunken crew overhead grew more
noisy and numerous, they overflowed into the
garden, trampling the neglected flower beds
and laughing like demons. Presently they
rushed to the cellar door and lifted it up wide.
They saw no light within, but a woman&#8217;s voice
shrieked:</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is any champagne, it&#8217;s in the cellar!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a torch was brought, and a man seizing
it jumped down the steps holding the torch
above his head, and came face to face with
Diane. Half a dozen men and women followed
him, and, catching sight of the wine bin, flew
toward it with shouts of devilish joy, and began
to hand out the bottles to those above them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>The man with the torch stuck it into an
empty bottle, and the light revealed, not only
Diane, but old Marie and Jean and François.
The invader wore the uniform of a colonel of
the National Guard, and was he who had once
been known as the Marquis Egmont de St.
Angel.</p>

CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE DAY OF GLORY HAS ARRIVED</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Well</span> now,&#8221; said he who had once been the
Marquis Egmont de St. Angel, but who now
called himself Colonel Egmont, addressing
Diane, &#8220;here I find you, my very proper young
lady, in bad company. How long have you
been down here living with these two men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nineteen days,&#8221; answered Diane, coming
a little closer to Egmont and fixing her eyes,
sparkling with rage, upon him. &#8220;Nineteen
days ago these two men came here wounded.
I have lived in this place with them ever since&mdash;do
you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly well,&#8221; responded Egmont with an
elaborate bow. &#8220;Now they and you shall
share the fate of the enemies of the Commune.
Come with me, all of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and climbed the narrow stone
steps again, followed by Diane and Jean and
François and old Marie. The mob in the garden
had already begun to drink the champagne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and they were so keen to get into the cellar
that they scarcely allowed their commander
to come up with his prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Egmont, calling to some National
Guards already drunk and trying to get
drunker, &#8220;find a cart to take these prisoners to
the Mazas prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not the slightest attention was paid to this
order until Egmont, drawing his pistol, covered
half a dozen National Guards, who then, with
champagne bottles tucked under their arms,
surrounded Diane and Jean and François.
Then Egmont sent one of them to stop a cart
rumbling by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t trust these fellows,&#8221; said Egmont,
stroking his mustache; &#8220;I shall have to go
with you, myself, to see that you are landed
safe in the Mazas just around the corner. As
for you, Mademoiselle, do you remember the
blow you struck me in the face six years ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the greatest pleasure,&#8221; responded
Diane sweetly; &#8220;I have never thought of that
blow without a thrill of joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied Egmont, smiling, &#8220;perhaps
you have not found out, in your retirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with these gentlemen, what has happened
to women who are the enemies of the Commune?
Twelve Dominican sisters disappeared a week
ago. They have never been heard from, and
never will be. Now, I intend to make you pay for
that blow, not once, but a thousand times over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t deprive me of the satisfaction
I have had all these years in the thought
that I struck it,&#8221; was Diane&#8217;s response, while
François remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I always thought that you, my Marquis of
the Holy Angels, were a cad and not a gentleman.
Now I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, Jean, who had said nothing, cast
a warning glance at Diane and François.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you mean by that look, Jean,&#8221;
said Diane, carefully smoothing her hair. &#8220;But
prudence is of no use when you are in the tiger&#8217;s
clutch&mdash;or rather the rhinoceros&mdash;for this
fat, ugly creature looks more like a rhinoceros
than a tiger. He means to murder us all, and
will do it, no matter how polite we might be.
Dear me! I really am not properly dressed
for a drive through the streets. No hat&mdash;no
gloves&mdash;no parasol.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>Jean sighed heavily for her, but François
only grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare, Skinny,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I believe you
really are a descendant of the Oriani family
of ancient Rome. You have such a glorious
spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I am not,&#8221; answered Diane, with a
demure smile. &#8220;My father was only the village
hatter. Like Napoleon, I am the first of my
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come you,&#8221; cried Egmont, &#8220;and bundle into
the cart. I shall go with you for the pleasure
of your company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they were all thrown into a cart, and a
National Guard, less drunk than the rest, took
the reins, while Egmont sat on the tail-board,
laughing and jeering at his prisoners.</p>

<p>The night sky was of a frightful crimson, while
a gigantic blanket of black smoke many miles
in length lay over the city which was blazing
on both sides of the river that ran red like
blood. On the spot where Diane and Jean had
sung La Marseillaise ten months before was a
great blazing pyre, the Palace of the Tuilleries,
and a ring of huge buildings for miles on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
side were sending up enormous masses of smoke
and flames. The heat in the May night was
terrific, and the smoke was like the smoke of hell.</p>

<p>Jean, who had said nothing, spoke a word
to Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we can die but once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; responded Diane. &#8220;And after
all, I have found out one thing before I die,
and that is, how much I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides the tumult that raged around them,
the noise of the heavy-laden cart traversing
the streets was great, but Diane, accustomed
to raising her voice so it could be heard afar,
could yet be heard clearly. She turned toward
Jean with ineffable tenderness in her voice and
smile, while the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel
heard every word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I always loved you, Jean, but after
I came to Paris and saw the other men, and
compared them with you, then I fell in love
with you. Don&#8217;t you remember last July,
the first time you came to my house with me,
what I said to you in the garden? I meant
it every word. I want you to love me in the
way that I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Egmont, raising his hand, struck Diane&#8217;s
white cheek a hard blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for the blow you gave me
and for your boldness, you shameless creature,
toward this man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean raised his foot and gave Egmont a kick
which knocked him off the tail-board and sent
him spinning to the street. He got up and
dusted his clothes, and, smiling, climbed back
into the cart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said, &#8220;see who wins the game of
life and death. As for you, Diane, you shall
pay for the kick as well as the slap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, my dear Marquis of the Holy
Angels,&#8221; said François in his musical drawl,
&#8220;you make me ashamed of our class. These
people are very humble, but their manners are
better than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Egmont laughed, and his eyes, filled with the
savage joy of a murderer who can murder in
safety, were fixed with amused contempt on
François.</p>

<p>The noise in the streets grew deafening.
The cordon was being tightened every moment
around the Communards. They were being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
driven in from every quarter, and a great mass
of drunken, shrieking, howling, laughing, singing
men and women choked the streets.</p>

<p>When the cart reached the prison of the
Mazas, the way was blocked by a crowd surrounding
a group of drunken women dancing,
and shrieking as they danced. As Egmont and
his three prisoners got out of the cart, Egmont
said to Diane:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, tuck up your skirts and dance
like those ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thank you,&#8221; sweetly responded Diane,
&#8220;I am not a dancer, but a singer, and I am not
in good voice to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then follow me,&#8221; said Egmont.</p>

<p>They followed him into the great, gloomy
prison, and a jailer led them into a long corridor
with iron doors. There were several vacant
cells, and in the first one François was thrust.
Before the door closed upon him, he caught
Diane&#8217;s hand, and suddenly, without the
slightest premonition, burst into passionate
weeping. She had seen him always laughing,
joking, drinking, fighting, dancing, and singing,
but never before, weeping. Even Egmont was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
stunned into silence at this strange burst of
grief. In a moment or two François had recovered
himself, and with an actor&#8217;s command
of countenance, his face suddenly shone with
smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Diane, it&#8217;s rather hard to say
good-by to you after all we have been through
together, and then not seeing you for so many
years, and being nursed and tended by you in
the cellar. I think it&#8217;s those infernal wounds
that have weakened me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, François,&#8221; answered Diane, &#8220;now
I come to think of it, you were always kind to
me. You taught me all my stage tricks, and
always let me take the curtain calls, and when
I was in a hurry to get to the theatre, you often
helped me wash the dishes; and when we were
living on the boat, you carried many heavy
parcels back and forth for me, and had always
been good-natured and laughing and joking.
After all, whether we are to live or whether we
are to die, we shall meet again. Good-by, dear
François.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane leaned her cheek toward François,
who kissed it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said, Egmont, himself once
more, &#8220;an old friend of yours, the Bishop of
Bienville, is a fellow-lodger in the same corridor.
The old scoundrel got caught in Paris, and we
nabbed him as an enemy of the Commune. I
think the order for his shooting is already given,
but you won&#8217;t be far behind him, I can promise
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, the jailer thrust François back into
a cell, and Egmont marched ahead, his two prisoners
in the middle and a couple of armed
guards behind.</p>

<p>When they reached a room which Egmont
called his quarters, he very politely ushered
Diane and Jean into it and closed the door.
The armed guards remained outside, but Egmont
notified them when he gave two raps on
the floor with his heel that they were to enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he to his prisoners, addressing
them both, &#8220;this young woman once treated
me with great scorn. I tell her, and I tell you,
Jean Leroux, that you shall be shot anyhow,
and so shall Mademoiselle Diane Dorian, unless
she agrees now and here to become my mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither Diane nor Jean turned pale. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
had lived through so many horrors in the last
frightful ten months, that they had come to
regard terrible catastrophies as the every-day
incidents of life.</p>

<p>Jean fixed his eyes on Diane, who turned to
him with a radiant smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Jean,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how little this
wretch knows me! I would rather die ten
times over than be his mistress. People are
dying all around us all the time, and we shall
go anyhow, a little sooner or a little later, and
it doesn&#8217;t matter, particularly as you are to
go too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Jean with equal coolness.
&#8220;You never were a coward, Diane, and
most women, I think, would die rather than
become this man&#8217;s mistress. As for myself&#8221;&mdash;Jean
snapped his fingers in the air&mdash;&#8220;I have
been looking death in the eye for ten months.
It isn&#8217;t so bad, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Egmont, looking at them, flew into a maniacal
rage. He reviled them, using horrible language.
He cursed them; he laughed at them like a
fiend. His revenge was not complete, because
he could not conquer their souls and destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
their courage as he could kill and mutilate their
bodies.</p>

<p>Two raps on the floor brought the guards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this scoundrel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and put
him in a cell. Lock this woman up. Twenty-four
hours will see the end of all of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have courage, Jean,&#8221; cried Diane, as she
walked away between her jailers. &#8220;I promise
you to die before I become the mistress of this
man or any other man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day at noon a shuffling procession
of a jailer and two National Guards opened the
door of François&#8217; cell, and walked in. The jailer,
a good-natured ruffian, read the name and number
written on the door, and then said to François:</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Jean Leroux, are to be shot at six
o&#8217;clock this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered François, cheerfully.
&#8220;I ask one thing&mdash;I should like to see the
Bishop of Bienville, who is in this corridor.
He can&#8217;t help me to escape, he is too fat, but
I should like to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are as many kinds of murderers as
there are murders, and the jailer in this case
was an amiable murderer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&#8220;I must take you to another cell,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;On the way you can stop long enough to make
your confession if that is what you want, you
superstitious fool, to the fat old fellow from
Bienville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; answered François;
&#8220;I thought to myself the first time I saw you
yesterday, &#8216;He is an obliging person.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come along with me now,&#8221; said the
jailer.</p>

<p>François got up nimbly, in spite of his wounded
leg, and followed the guard along the corridor,
chatting agreeably with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear,&#8221; said the jailer when they got to
the Bishop&#8217;s door, &#8220;I am sorry such a pleasant
fellow as you is to be shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could only have known me in my past
days, and seen some of my juggling tricks and
heard me sing, you would be sorrier still,&#8221;
replied François, affably. &#8220;You are quite a
decent fellow, and if circumstances had permitted,
I should have been glad to cultivate
your further acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer laughed, and unlocking the door
of a cell, opened it, saying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&#8220;Half an hour is all I can give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>François found himself in the cell with the
Bishop, and the door locked.</p>

<p>The Bishop was not so stout and ruddy as
he had been, but pinched and sallow, for he
had been prisoner for a month. He was, however,
just as glad to see François, and kissed
him on both cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, your Grace,&#8221; said François, squatting
on the cot, and refusing to take the only chair
in the cell, &#8220;I have no time to sing the old songs
for you. I have only time to do what you
often urged me in the old days in Bienville.
That is, to confess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven be praised!&#8221; piously responded
the Bishop; &#8220;I always told my brother, the
General, and Mathilde that you were really
an excellent person, and that some day you
would become a penitent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not much time to lose,&#8221; said François,
&#8220;as I am to be shot at six o&#8217;clock this
afternoon. By the way, what has become of the
General and Mathilde? I always hated her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother is in a Prussian prison. Mathilde
is, I suppose, still at Bienville. I wish the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
bishop joy of her if he gets her for a housekeeper.
For I hardly think that I shall ever
leave Paris alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has indeed become a cursed place,&#8221;
replied François. &#8220;I never thought that I
should weary of Paris, but I assure your Grace
I shall be glad to get out of it on almost any
terms, even being shot. But as I have only
a half hour in which to confess the sins of thirty
years, I think I had better begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>François went down on his knees, and began
a rapid confession of many and grievous sins.
The last item was:</p>

<p>&#8220;And I propose to tell a lie and to say that
I am Jean Leroux, for whom I am mistaken and
numbered and put down in a book, and to be
shot in the place of Leroux, an excellent fellow
and an old comrade of mine, who is loved by a
woman whom I love. So I think it is better
to tell the lie and to die in the place of Leroux.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop, who had been leaning back,
quietly listening with closed eyes to the most
remarkable confession he had ever heard, sat
up straight and looked sternly at François.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not permit it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is suicide.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&#8220;But your Grace can&#8217;t help yourself,&#8221; responded
François, still on his knees. &#8220;It was
told you in confession, and you are not permitted
to reveal the secrets of the confessional
either to save your own life or anybody else&#8217;s
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop fell back in his chair, his good-natured,
sallow, pinched face grown more sallow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can refuse to give you absolution,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if a man dies to save the life of another
man, he is absolved by his blood,&#8221; said François,
triumphantly. &#8220;You see, I am a better
theologian than your Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop leaned forward, and, opening his
arms, drew to his breast the kneeling François.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be absolved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Make a
good act of contrition, and pray for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The half hour was soon over, but long before
that François had finished his confession, and
he and the Bishop were chatting together
pleasantly, and even laughing.</p>

<p>When the door was opened, and the time
came for the last farewell, they kissed each other
on the cheek affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for all your kindness,&#8221; said François,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
&#8220;and make my apologies to Mathilde for
all the trouble I gave her. Now, your Grace
knows that I am a true penitent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; replied the Bishop, smiling and
blinking, &#8220;that I stand no more chance of seeing
Mathilde than you. We shall both be called
upon to make our apologies to the Most High,
shortly. Meanwhile, pray that when my time
comes I may be as cool and unconcerned as
you. I cannot say that I would wish to live
as you have lived, Monsieur François le Bourgeois,
as you call yourself, but I would certainly
wish to die like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried François, gayly. &#8220;Living is
much more important than dying. <i>Au revoir</i>
to your Grace. These Communards are such
fools, they won&#8217;t find out for a week that they
got the wrong pig by the ear.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, the door closed, and François
marched off cheerfully with his jailers to another
cell in which he was to spend the three hours
of life that remained to him. The cell was
much larger and brighter than the one he had
left, but cold and damp, in spite of the May
heat and the fiercely burning city.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Of this, François complained bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean,&#8221; he said, &#8220;by putting
me in this place where I shall be certain to
catch cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer, who had a rudimentary sense of
humor, grinned at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard a good many condemned persons
grumble at their fate, but you are the first
one I have seen who is afraid of catching cold
three hours before he is introduced to a firing
squad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; replied François, &#8220;I am a gentleman,
although somewhat in eclipse, and I want a
fire made in this place, because I wish to be comfortable
as long as I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer, still laughing, opened the door and
called to a colleague, who brought a brazier and
some charcoal, of which François secured several
lumps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel in the vein for poetry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
I wish to write some verses on this wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the jailer made a little fire in the brazier,
François stood in meditation before the whitewashed
wall, writing a few words, then rubbing
them out with his sleeve, sometimes finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a whole line with many corrections, just as poets
usually do.</p>

<p>He was so absorbed in his composition that an
hour passed, and he was surprised by the jailer
bringing in supper at five o&#8217;clock. The jailer,
who was more and more disposed to be friendly
with his prisoner, laughed at the way in which
François drew up his stool, surveyed the rude
fare, and turned up his nose at it.</p>

<p>In the crises of life, men revert to their original
type; so François, who called himself Le Bourgeois,
suddenly and naturally became an aristocrat,
such as he had been thirty years before. He tasted
some potatoes, and then eyed them disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the fare I mind, my good friend,&#8221;
he said to the jailer, &#8220;nor yet the austere simplicity
with which you serve it, but these potatoes
are only half boiled, and will certainly
make me ill. You should have some care for
the health of your prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer sat down and laughed with unrestrained
enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are such an entertaining
fellow, it is a shame you are to be shot
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8220;So do I think,&#8221; responded François, attacking
a morsel of very tough beef, &#8220;and I am very
much surprised, too; but it is the unexpected, you
know, which happens. Life is made up of one
infernal blunder after another.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer was so pleased with his prisoner, he
put his hand in his pocket and drew out a little
flask of brandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t much, but it is
enough for a swig.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, this is the first satisfactory thing I
have known you to do since our acquaintance
began,&#8221; said François, putting the flask to his
mouth and draining it dry.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not indeed much,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it
was a great deal better than nothing. It will
give me inspiration to finish my verses. Excuse
me for hurrying through with this luxurious meal.
I don&#8217;t suppose you would serve any better to
Lucullus himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no person by that name in this
prison,&#8221; replied the jailer with simple good
faith, &#8220;and the same food is served to all. That
poor bishop has evidently been accustomed to a
good cook, and prison fare goes hard with him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>The jailer found the conversation of his prisoner
so agreeable that he remained until François
had finished the beef. The potatoes he refused
to touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am taking a great risk of indigestion in eating
this tough meat,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it would
be tempting fate to touch those potatoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer went out, repeating that he was sorry
that six o&#8217;clock would end their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Through the small, heavily barred windows
looking westward, François could hear the roar
of the battle in the city, the distant, incessant
thunder of the guns, and see the great waves of
flame and smoke from the burning city drifting
slowly in the stagnant air. A dun light that was
not day nor night lay over Paris, and, although it
was but a little after five o&#8217;clock, the whitewashed
cell was dusky.</p>

<p>François continued cheerfully absorbed in his
poetic composition. When he reached the fourth
line and made a period, he stood off and read
his verses with even more than the average satisfaction
of a poet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be time,&#8221; he said to himself aloud,
&#8220;to write another verse, so here goes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>He then began another line, and wrote three and
a half lines more. At this point, while
François was deeply reflecting on a word, the key
was turned in the door which was flung open, and
the jailer, with a couple of deputies, was standing
outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very sorry, sir,&#8221; said the jailer, &#8220;but the
time is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only say,&#8221; replied François, &#8220;that your
visit is most inopportune. I am just in the
midst of the best line in my poem. Like everything
else, the Commune annoys everybody.
Seven o&#8217;clock for my exit would not have hurt
the Commune, and would have enabled me to
finish my poem. Listen, and if you have any
poetic instinct, you will agree that this is the
finest thing since Rouget de Lisle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer knew no more about Rouget de
Lisle than he did about Lucullus, and frankly
said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great poets,&#8221; complained François, &#8220;are as
scarce as seventeen-year locusts&mdash;and when at
last I develop into a great poet, the Commune
proceeds to shoot me. If I were a bad poet now,
shooting would be too good for me. Listen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>Then standing a little way off, he read his
poem with all the force and feeling of an actor.
These were the lines&mdash;ordinary enough, but
François&#8217; reading made them respectable:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;We dream a turbid dream, all strife,</div>
<div class="indent">Full of sharp pain and ecstasy,</div>
<div class="indent">Pale ghosts of Love and Joy we see,</div>
<div class="verse">And call our dreaming, Life.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;We waken in the darkling hour,</div>
<div class="indent">The last before the dawn appears,</div>
<div class="indent">Shuddering, we see the Gate of Tears,</div>
<div class="verse">When lo! Immortal Light&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;If I had a little more time,&#8221; said François,
&#8220;I could finish the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer and his two deputies had but a dim
understanding of François&#8217; verses, but his practised
and musical voice, his eloquent eyes, made
them feel something, and the jailer, who had a
streak of humanity in him, suddenly began
winking his small, dull eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said François, putting on his
hat, &#8220;for wearing my hat in your august presence,
but I am determined not to catch cold. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
remember, I am Jean Leroux, the descendant, as
the name indicates, of a family of Spanish hidalgos
with large possessions in the Philippines.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer knew enough to understand that
this was a joke, and he said, trying to laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Jean Leroux, I won&#8217;t forget you,
and I shall tell everybody who asks for you,
&#8216;That fellow Leroux was a cool hand.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer then produced a rope and proceeded
to tie François&#8217; hands behind his back. He was
gentle about it, and asked François if it hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied François, &#8220;but I hope it won&#8217;t
take the skin off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then began a march through the dim corridor
at the end of which were found half a dozen
other unfortunates to be stood up against the
wall before a firing squad.</p>

<p>All were calm except an old priest, who said with
a tremulous smile to François, standing next him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I should tremble so, because
I am already seventy-seven years old, and could
not live much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; answered François, &#8220;you should
not mind a little thing like a bullet, which will
send you to heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>&#8220;True,&#8221; said the old man, suddenly straightening
himself up; &#8220;your words are words of wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued François, ranging himself
by the side of the old priest as the sombre procession
marched two and two down the stone
stairs, &#8220;I have a great deal to answer for in the
next half hour, but, I tell you, I believe God is a
good deal easier on His poor children than men
are to each other. The devil is a <i>sans culotte</i>.
I chummed with him, but I never mistook him
for a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said the old priest as he clumped
feebly down the stairs worn by the feet of many
prisoners, &#8220;you do for me what I should do for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grewsome procession, headed and flanked
and enclosed by guards and jailers, passed
through the courtyard until they came to a
garden. On one side was a long, lately opened
trench.</p>

<p>Around them, afar off, was a gigantic circle
of leaping flames. Over them hung the greatest
smoke bank the world ever saw, while the stench
of powder and blood polluted the soft May air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The place was full of National Guards, many of
them drunk, all of them bewildered, stunned,
and terrified by the cordon of fire and steel that
was tightening around them every hour. But
they were murdering to the last.</p>

<p>When the procession was halted, and the prisoners
were stood up against the stone wall of the
garden, the officer in command was the Marquis
Egmont de St. Angel. He grinned when he saw
François.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come now, before
we spoil your beauty, give us a song and
dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My regular price for a performance,&#8221; said
François, &#8220;is five hundred francs, and you probably
have not that much about you. Besides,
although, like you, my Marquis Egmont of the
Holy Angels, I have not lived as a gentleman,
unlike you, I mean to die as a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; cried Egmont to the firing squad,
which marched out and took their places.</p>

<p>The old priest lifted his bound hands and
blessed and absolved them all, prisoners and
murderers alike. Egmont laughed loudly at this,
but François bent his head. Then he raised it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and fixed his bright, dark eyes full on Egmont.
The gaze seemed to fascinate, to accuse, to condemn,
and to terrify him. Just then, a sudden,
sharp, vagrant wind cleft the dun cloud of
smoke, and a ray of pale splendor shone for a
moment on the face of François. Egmont, in
desperation, to escape the piercing eyes of François,
shouted, &#8220;Fire!&#8221; A straggling volley
rang out, and François and the old priest and
the other four men fell forward prone to the
ground. The little spark of life left their
mangled bodies and sped with ever increasing
light and glory to the other world.</p>

<p>The bodies were rolled in canvas, and thrown
into the trench and hastily covered with earth,
but the jailer, who had seen it all, observed that
François was laid at the head of the trench.</p>

<p>Then was heard a quick, wild thunder of guns
as if coming from the ground under their feet,
and from two streets they saw a disorderly multitude
of National Guards being driven before
two red-legged columns of soldiers. The jailer,
who was not without sense, saw that all was
over. He ran back to the prison, raced up the
stairs, and along the corridor, unlocking every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
door. Some of the prisoners, he thought, would
save his life for that one act.</p>

<p>When he reached Diane&#8217;s door, it was the last,
and he flung it wide. She was standing calmly
in the middle of the cell, and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the jailer. &#8220;The soldiers are
here; listen to the wheels of the mitrailleuse
down in the courtyard. I am trying to turn these
prisoners loose before a fire breaks out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face was deadly pale, and with his
hand he wiped drops from his dirty forehead.
He had seen enough of the death of others not to
like the prospect for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a pity,&#8221; he mumbled nervously; &#8220;not
ten minutes ago six prisoners were shot, one of
them an old, tottering priest, and another, Jean
Leroux, the bravest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean Leroux, did you say?&#8221; asked Diane,
coming up close to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the jailer, &#8220;an actor and
singer, and Colonel Egmont, as he calls himself
now, though he was a marquis the other day,
taunted Jean Leroux thirty seconds before he
was shot.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>&#8220;Where is Colonel Egmont, as you call him?&#8221;
asked Diane, still calmly, and without a tremor
in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows,&#8221; answered the jailer. &#8220;He was
in the courtyard a moment ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diane rushed by the jailer, and ran along the
corridor, down the stairs, and bareheaded into
the courtyard. Egmont was there trying to
subdue the panic among his men and to induce
them to make a last stand, but no one heeded him.
There was running to and fro and throwing down
of arms and the steady cracking rifles of skilled
soldiers.</p>

<p>Egmont, cursing and swearing, turned, and
was faced by Diane.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have killed the man I
love. Well, then, I can love him just as much
dead as when he was living. Did you not know
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; responded Egmont, &#8220;that women
are great fools where men are concerned. I
didn&#8217;t know that Jean Leroux had been shot,
but I am glad of it. François le Bourgeois has
just been put to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind them a string of prisoners was trooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
out. One of them, a big man, came up and
caught Diane around the waist and began dragging
her down the steps and into a blind alley
that opened upon the courtyard, for bullets were
now flying and cracking, and a gun was being
trained down either street.</p>

<p>As Diane turned and saw that it was Jean
Leroux whose arm was around her, she suddenly
became as a dead woman in his arms. She was
so slim that it was easy enough for Jean to pick
her up and carry her into the blind alley, where
he was about to lay her flat upon the cold stones
when she revived and stood upon her feet, for
Diane was a strong woman and not given to
fainting.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me you were shot,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; answered Jean. &#8220;Come, let us
find a cellar. We have been in cellars before,
and found them pleasant enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldiers did not make as short work as
they expected of Egmont and his crew. For
an hour, Jean and Diane, listening in a black
and slimy cellar, heard desperate fighting going
on around them, the few wretches who remained
dying hard, like wild animals at bay. Half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
dozen smouldering fires were put out in that time,
and the soldiers, at their leisure and without
burning anything, finally got possession of the
prison of the Mazas.</p>

<p>It was black night, but the sky was still illuminated
with a dreadful and appalling glory
when Diane and Jean finally crept once more
into the blind alley. The soldiers were carrying
off a badly wounded man, cursing and denouncing
all men and their Maker. It was he
who was once the Marquis Egmont de St. Angel.</p>

<p>The officer in command was surprised, if
anything could surprise one in those frightful
hours, to see a woman in such a place. Diane
showed an admirable calmness, and Jean, as
usual, had little to say. The jailer, hovering
around and seeing Diane, came up cringing.</p>

<p>&#8220;This lady will tell you, sir,&#8221; he said to the
officer, &#8220;that I opened the doors of all the cells
as soon as I could, fearing a fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; answered Diane, &#8220;but why did you
tell me that Jean Leroux was shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he told me so himself,&#8221; cried the
jailer, nervously. &#8220;When I showed him the
warrant for the shooting of Jean Leroux, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
&#8216;I am Jean Leroux,&#8217; and he told me so a dozen
times. The Bishop that was in the prison knows
the man who was shot. The Bishop has gone
back to his cell, because he has nowhere else to
go until to-morrow, and if this officer will let us,
I will take you to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Diane and Jean were in the
Bishop&#8217;s cell, which was lighted only by a lantern
carried by the jailer, for prisoners were not allowed
lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your Grace bear me out,&#8221; said the
jailer, who had decided to recognize the Bishop&#8217;s
dignity, since the Commune was at an end,
&#8220;that the man who was shot this afternoon gave
his name as Jean Leroux?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; cried the Bishop with animation,
rising. &#8220;Well, then, that man, whatever his
name may be, or whatever his life may have been,
died nobly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A silence which the jailer could not understand
prevailed in the cell. The two men and the
woman looked at each other with a strange
understanding and eloquence in the eyes of all.</p>

<p>The jailer, very anxious to make favor for
himself, continued:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>&#8220;If you will come with me to the cell that the
dead man occupied, I will show you his handwriting
on the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still silent, the Bishop walking heavily, they
went down the corridor, and the jailer opened
the door of the cell, large and with many windows,
and swung the lantern so that its yellow
gleam fell upon the whitewashed wall.</p>

<p>The Bishop read the first two lines, and then
his voice broke. Neither Diane nor Jean took
up the reading.</p>

<p>The jailer, still obsequious, chattered on.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was the coolest hand I ever saw, and
making jokes until the very last, complaining
that he would catch cold if he didn&#8217;t
wear his hat on the way to be shot. He
was very proud of his poetry, and complained
only that he had not time to finish the
last verse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bishop, a man of simple mind, went down
on his knees, and Diane and Jean knelt, too.
So did the jailer, who did not mind a little thing
like that in order to keep the good-will of his
recent prisoners.</p>

<p>The Bishop made a prayer for the soul of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
François, known as Le Bourgeois, a prayer that
came from the heart of an honest man.</p>

<p>When they rose, Jean said to the Bishop:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we know that François, whom the
world reckoned a rapscallion, was a better man
than most. He stood up against the wall, and
was huddled into the trench in my place, not so
much for my sake as for this woman, whom, I
know now, he loved well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he then buried in the trench?&#8221; asked the
Bishop. &#8220;He must be taken out this night and
given Christian burial.&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy silence had fallen over the quarter
where lately there had been the shrieking of
bullets and the thunder of guns. Still the city
was burning and shrouded in smoke, but the
Commune was throttled and dead.</p>

<p>In finding François, everything was done quite
as informally as shooting him. The Bishop
stood by the trench in the darkness, which was
lighted only by the jailer&#8217;s lantern.</p>

<p>The trench was the last one dug by the Communards,
and was so hastily filled that the dirt
was easily thrown aside by a couple of soldiers
hired to do the work, Jean helping with a spade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
They lifted François out, looking strangely
young and natural when the canvas in which his
body was wrapped was removed.</p>

<p>Diane was a little way off,&mdash;it was no sight for
a woman,&mdash;but at that moment she entered the
garden in the dusk, carrying something in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is something in which to
wrap François. I went to the officer commanding
at the jail, and told him that François was a
soldier of France who had died bravely, and that
he was entitled to have the tricolor laid upon
him dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a small flag, such as batteries of artillery
carry in case they should lose or be separated
from their colors.</p>

<p>Diane, kneeling on the ground, wrapped François&#8217;
body in it, and then leaned over and kissed
his dead face.</p>

<p>There was a little half-wrecked church in the
neighborhood, and there François was carried
by the soldiers, with the jailer and Jean assisting,
and followed by the Bishop. They laid him
down on the pavement before the desecrated
altar, and there Jean watched by him the whole
night through.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>The church was dark, although the windows
were broken out and a shell had made a great
gaping hole in the roof, but the light of the moon
and the stars was quenched by the great pall
of smoke that enveloped the vast city.</p>

<p>Occasionally Jean would rise and go near the
altar and look down at François, mute and meek,
for even François le Bourgeois was meek in death.</p>

<p>Jean&#8217;s memory, travelling back slowly but accurately
to the beginning of things, recalled that
François had loved Diane from the first, but
had been clever enough to keep the preposterous
thing to himself. Well, François was ever a mystery
and a contradiction, and so his death contradicted
his whole life, and atoned for it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two weeks later, on a beautiful June morning,
the Bishop had what was left of François le Bourgeois
interred close to the walls of the little old
cathedral of Bienville.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said the Bishop, to Diane and Jean
Leroux, who were present, &#8220;when I die, they will
put me in the church on the other side of the wall,
and I think I should like to be near François,
for, to tell you the truth, I loved him better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
I ever acknowledged. He was such an amusing
fellow, you know, and I had known him when he
was the child of greatness and I was the boy
who tended the cows. François and I, having
been together in our boyhood, will be close together
at the end, and I am sure when the last
trump sounds, François will rise with a joke
upon his lips; otherwise, it would not be François
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>After François had finally been laid to rest,
Diane and Jean went into a side chapel of the
cathedral, and were married by the Bishop.
When the ceremony was over, the new-made
wife of Jean Leroux went out and laid her bridal
bouquet upon the grave of François; who called
himself Le Bourgeois.</p>

<p>The human note in <i>Jim Hands</i>, the reality of its people and
the universal appeal of its story were much commended by the
critics upon the publication of that novel last year. These
same characteristics distinguish the new book. Some of the
incidents described are full of the well-turned humor for which
Mr. Child is so well known; others where life is looked at
seriously, are grave, but all are human to the core.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Of all the masters of fiction, both in Russia and elsewhere,
Dostoevski is the most truly spiritual,&#8221; William Lyon Phelps
says in his recently published <i>Essays on Russian Novelists</i>. The
publication of this new translation of Dostoevski&#8217;s five great
works, introducing the author as it undoubtedly will to many
American readers, is a notable event in the world of letters.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mother love, all powerful, self-sacrificing, wonderful, sacred,
the love which endures through all things, is the theme of this
story. Hitherto Miss Gale has portrayed the tender love of old
age, and the vigorous love of youth, but perhaps in none of her
previous books, charming and beautiful as they are, has she
had a subject of so universal an appeal or one which clutches
hold of the heart strings so tightly.</p></blockquote>

about the great Christmas festival of the Nativity.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New

drawing, and that gossipy desultory style of writing that
stamps Mr. White&#8217;s literary work, will earn a high place in
fiction. It is good and clean and provides a vacation from
the cares of the hour. It resembles a Chinese play, because it
begins with the hero&#8217;s boyhood, describes his long, busy life,
and ends with his death. Its tone is often religious, never flippant,
and one of its best assets is its glowing descriptions of the
calm, serene beauties of nature. Its moral is that a magnate
never did any real good with money.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Oregonian</i>, Portland,
